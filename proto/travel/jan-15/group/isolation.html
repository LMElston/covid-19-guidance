                <p>Quarantine or isolation is mandatory for people coming to Canada.</p>
                <p>Quarantine and isolation plans are evaluated by government representatives at the border to determine
                    whether they’re suitable. This includes the risk to public health and the health and safety of those
                    staying at the place of quarantine.</p>
                <p>The Government of Canada has put in place an <a

                <h2 class="h3">Consequences for failure to comply with the Emergency Order</h2>

                <p>Failure to comply with this order is an offence under the Quarantine Act and could lead to
                    <strong>imprisonment and/or fines</strong>.

                    <ul>
                        <li>a fine of up to $1,000,000 <strong>or</strong></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The <cite>Contraventions Act</cite> provides police (including RCMP, provincial and local police)
                        more power to enforce the <cite>Contraventions Act</cite>. They can now issue tickets to people

                <p>If you can enter Canada and <strong>you have no symptoms</strong>, you must
                    <strong>quarantine</strong> for 14 days. This is mandatory and starts from the date you arrive in

                <p>If you begin to show symptoms during your quarantine, are exposed to another traveller with symptoms,
                    or test positive for COVID-19, you must begin an additional 14 days of isolation.</p>

                <h3 id="plan">Your quarantine plan</h3>
                <p>As a traveller, you <strong>must</strong> demonstrate that you have an adequate plan for quarantine.
                    You’re expected to make plans, within your own means, before travelling to Canada. <strong>Foreign
                        nationals</strong> who do not have an adequate plan may be denied entry into Canada.</p>
                <p>As of November 21, 2020, it is mandatory to electronically submit your quarantine plan.</p>
                <p>You will be asked questions about your plans for quarantine upon arrival.</p>
