        <p>All travellers <strong>5 years of age or older</strong>, regardless of citizenship, must provide proof of a
            negative COVID-19 test result. You don't require a test to fly within Canada.</p>
        <p>At this time, proof of <strong>vaccination does not replace a valid test result</strong>.</p>
        <p>You must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>take the test within 72 hours of the scheduled departure time of your flight to Canada</li>
            <ul>
                <li>if you have a connecting flight:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the test must be conducted within 72 hours of the scheduled departure time of your last direct
                        flight to Canada</li>
                    <li>you may need to schedule the test in your transit city</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>provide one of the accepted types of tests, <strong>not an antigen test</strong></li>
            <li>keep proof of your test results for the 14-day period that begins on the day you enter Canada</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Airlines will refuse boarding to travellers who are unable to provide a valid molecular test result. </p>

                are no longer infectious. </p>
            <p>Travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 <strong>must provide proof</strong> of a

            <p>All travellers arriving in Canada are obligated by Canadian law to respond truthfully to all questions.
                Providing false information to a Government of Canada official upon entry to Canada is a serious offence
                and may result in penalties and/or criminal charges. Foreign nationals who provide false information
                could also be denied entry to the country and/or be barred from returning to Canada.</p>
            <p>Making a false declaration when boarding a flight to Canada, including the presentation of a fraudulent
                test result, carries the potential for up to $5,000 in administrative monetary penalties under the
                Aeronautics Act, in addition to a fine of $3000 under the Quarantine Act, if the same false document is
                also presented upon entry into Canada. </p>
            <p>Violating any instructions provided when you enter Canada or putting others at risk of a serious
                communicable disease are offences under the Quarantine Act and could lead to up to three years in prison
                and/or up to $1 million in fines.</p>
