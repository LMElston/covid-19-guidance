        <p>You must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><mark>Driving to land border crossing:</mark>take a test in the United States within 72 hours of your

            <p>These tests are considered acceptable molecular tests:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PCR - Polymerase chain reaction</li>
                <li>RT-PCR – reverse transcription real time PCR</li>

            </ul>
            <p>These tests use methods such as a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, nose swab, or saliva sample. At this time,
                proof of having a vaccine will not replace a negative test result.</p>

            <p>The Government of Canada will notify travellers should it become mandatory to obtain COVID-19 molecular
                tests from specific accredited laboratories or facilities.</p>
        </details>

        <h3 id="providing-proof">Providing proof of your result </h3>

        <p>You must present an accepted test result (paper or electronic proof) which must include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traveller name and date of birth</li>
            <li>Name and civic address of the laboratory/clinic/facility that administered the test</li>

            <li>The test result</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You <strong>must</strong> show proof of your test results even if you: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>have tested negative for COVID-19 previous to the 72 hour period</li>
            <li>have been vaccinated for COVID-19</li>
            <li>recovered from COVID-19 and no longer test positive</li>
            <li>recovered from COVID-19 and continue to test positive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At this time, travellers should have their test performed at a reputable laboratory or testing facility
            (i.e., one recognized by the local government or accredited by a third party, such as a professional
            organization or international standards organization).</p>

            <p>All travellers arriving in Canada are obligated by Canadian law to respond truthfully to all questions.
                Providing false information to a Government of Canada official upon entry to Canada is a serious offence
                and may result in penalties and/or criminal charges. Foreign nationals who provide false information
                could also be denied entry to the country and/or be barred from returning to Canada.</p>
            <p>Making a false declaration when boarding a flight to Canada, including the presentation of a fraudulent
                test result, carries the potential for up to $5,000 in administrative monetary penalties under the
                Aeronautics Act, in addition to a fine of $5000 under the Quarantine Act, if the same false document is
                also presented upon entry into Canada. </p>
            <p>Violating any instructions provided when you enter Canada or putting others at risk of a serious
                communicable disease are offences under the Quarantine Act and could lead to up to three years in prison
                and/or up to $1 million in fines.</p>
