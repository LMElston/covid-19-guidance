            <p>All travellers arriving in Canada are obligated by Canadian law to respond truthfully to all questions.
                Providing false information to a Government of Canada official upon entry to Canada is a serious offence
                and may result in penalties and/or criminal charges. Foreign nationals who provide false information
                could also be denied entry to the country and/or be barred from returning to Canada.</p>
            <p>Making a false declaration when boarding a flight to Canada, including the presentation of a fraudulent
                test result, carries the potential for up to $5,000 in administrative monetary penalties under the
                Aeronautics Act, in addition to a fine of $5000 under the Quarantine Act, if the same false document is
                also presented upon entry into Canada. </p>
            <p>Violating any instructions provided when you enter Canada or putting others at risk of a serious
                communicable disease are offences under the Quarantine Act and could lead to up to three years in prison
                and/or up to $1 million in fines.</p>
