<h2 id="fn-compassion">Foreign nationals applying for compassionate entry</h2>
<p>All Foreign nationals <strong>must apply</strong> for and receive written approval for compassionate entry in order
   to enter Canada. Without this advanced approval, you will likely be <strong>denied entry</strong>.</p>
<p>You can apply to enter for the following compassionate reasons:
<ul>
   <li>to be present during the final moments of life for a loved one</li>
   <li>to provide support to a person who is critically ill as determined by a licensed health care practitioner in
      Canada</li>
   <li>to provide care to a person who has a medical reason as determined by a licensed health care practitioner in
      Canada</li>
   <li>to attend a funeral or end of life ceremony</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The person you will care for, visit at end of life, or attend the funeral of must reside in Canada and be either:
<ul>
   <li>a Canadian citizen</li>
   <li>a permanent resident of Canada</li>
   <li>a temporary resident of Canada</li>
   <li>a protected person (refugee status) <strong>or</strong></li>
   <li>a person registered under the <cite>Indian Act</cite></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Limited (temporary) release from quarantine for compassionate reasons</h3>
<p>If required, you can request a limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons as part of your
   compassionate entry application.</p>
<p>Some provinces and territories may not allow for limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons. This
   means that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada a province or territory may have
   additional restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and provincial or
   territorial travel restrictions, you must comply with those that is are the most stringent.</p>
<p>Before applying, please check provincial or territorial requirements and check back often to find out if any of their
   quarantine requirements prohibit limited release from quarantine.</p>
