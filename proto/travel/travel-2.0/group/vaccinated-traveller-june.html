            Fully vaccinated travellers who meet all criteria must have a suitable quarantine plan. If you have symptoms

         <p>While in transit to your place of quarantine, you must follow all public health measures, such as wearing a
            mask.</p>
         <p>Provinces and territories may have their own provincial border measures as well as public health guidelines
            within their jurisdictions, so it is important that travellers check for the most up-to-date travel

         <h3>Arrival testing</h3>
         <p>Follow the instructions provided to you upon entry
            to Canada to complete your arrival (day 1)
            test. Airports and some land borders have on-site
            services where you can complete your test before
            continuing on to your place of quarantine.
         </p>
         <p>If you receive a home test kit, complete it on the day you arrive and send it to the lab following the
            instructions provided.</p>
         <p>If your arrival test is negative:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>your mandatory quarantine period is complete
               and you may now leave quarantine
            </li>
            <li>you may continue to receive emails and notifications from ArriveCAN after you’ve left quarantine, but
               you don’t need to do daily reports</li>
            <li>follow local public health measures</li>
            <li>maintain a list of all close contacts for your first 14 days in Canada</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If your arrival test is positive:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>do not leave your place of quarantine</li>
            <li>begin a 14-day isolation period starting
               from the date you took your test
            </li>
            <li>you may continue to receive emails and notifications from ArriveCAN after you’ve left quarantine, but
               you don’t need to do daily reports</li>
            <li>you will be contacted by Government of
               Canada and provincial or territorial officials
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2>How to meet the full vaccinated exemption</h2>
         <p>In ArriveCAN, <strong>you must provide</strong>:
         <ul>
            <li>the details of your first dose (date, country and vaccine you received)</li>
            <li>the details of your second dose if you received one</li>
            <li>proof of your vaccinations as a photo or photos, PDF file(s) with
               receipts or confirmations from the vaccinating organization </li>
         </ul>
         Final determination of your status will be made at
         the border. Bring a copy of your proof(s) of
         vaccination with you.</p>
         <h3>Authorized vaccines for proof of vaccination</h3>
         <p>Fully vaccinated means having received the full dosage of vaccine at least 14 days prior to entering Canada.
         </p>
         <p>You may have received your vaccine in any country. At this time, Canada is only accepting vaccines
            authorized by Health Canada. The list of accepted vaccines may expand in the future.</p>

         <p>To be considered fully vaccinated, you must have:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>received the full dosage of vaccine at least 14 days before your entry into Canada:</li>
            <ul>
               <li>2 doses of any combination of Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines <strong>or</strong></li>

               <li>one dose of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine</li>
            </ul>
         </ul>
         <h3 id="uploading-proof">Uploading proof of your vaccination in ArriveCAN</h3>
         <p>In ArriveCAN, you must upload proof of vaccination. Bring a copy of the same proofs
            that you upload with you to the border. The receipt(s) must be in English or
            French, or a certified translation.</p>
         <p>The proof you upload must show clearly show:
         <ul>
            <li>your name and birth date</li>
            <li>the date you received the vaccine</li>
            <li>the vaccine you received</li>
         </ul>
         <p>You can upload a:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>PDF file or files <!-- after your vaccination, you may have received a PDF receipt or confirmation from a
               government agency. Uploading a PDF file is preferred to uploading a photo. </li>
            <ul>
               <li>For example, in most Canadian provinces, a PDF receipt was emailed to vaccine recipients. Save the
                  attached file to your desktop and upload it.</li>
            </ul>
         -->
            <li>photo or photos of your receipt(s) </li>
<!--
            <ul>
               <li>for example, upload a file that is a photo of your CDC card, or
                  of the confirmation you received from the organization or government that provided your vaccine</li>
               <li>Hint: if you aren't sure how to find the filename of a photo, most smartphones have an easy way to
                  email a photo. Email it to yourself, and save the attachment in the email to your desktop with a
                  filename you can easily find again. Then when you click 'Upload' in ArriveCAN, you'll know where to
                  find the file, and the file's name. </li>
            </ul>
