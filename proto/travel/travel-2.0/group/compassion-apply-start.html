                <h3>Private sites</h3>
               
                  <p>You need to attach a signed Site Visit Authorization Form from the administrator, proprietor or homeowner

               <p>You don't need a Site Visit Authorization Form if you're visiting a public outdoor setting
                  or site, for example, a ceremony in a public park.</p>
	      
               <h3>Provincial and territorial restrictions</h3>
	      
	      <p>Before applying, please check provincial or territorial requirements.</p>
	      
	       <p>Some provinces and territories may not allow release from quarantine for compassionate
                  reasons. This
                  means that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada, a province or
                  territory may have
                  additional restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and
                  provincial or
                  territorial travel restrictions, you must comply with those that are the most stringent.</p>
	      
               <p>Check back regularly as these restrictions can change.</p>

               <summary>Proof of death</summary>

               <p id="proof-of-death">As a foreign national, if you request to enter Canada attend a funeral or end of
                  life ceremony, you require proof
                  of
                  death. The
                  following documents are examples that can be used as
                  part of the death notification:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>burial permit</li>
                  <li>death certificate</li>
                  <li>statement of death</li>
                  <li>medical certificate of death</li>
                  <li>letter from the funeral home</li>
               </ul>

               <p>If the funeral or end of life ceremony will occur during your quarantine
                  period, you
                  will require
                  a Site Visit Authorization Form(s) in order to attend.</p>

            </details>

            <p>It's an offence under the Quarantine Act to provide a false or misleading statement, which could lead to up to:</p>
            
            <ul>
               <li>6 months in prison and/or</li>
               <li>$750,000 in fines</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 3: Complete your request for exemption with the attachments</h2>

            <p><strong>Start the request for exemption form</strong> only once you have the appropriate documents for your situation completed, signed and ready to attach. (Site authorization form, Letter of support, 
               or Proof of death)</p>
         <p>Your request will not be accepted if it is
               incomplete.</p>
            <h3>Tips for the request for exemption form</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>You <strong>won't be able to save the form for completion later</strong></li>
               <li>There are 8 pages in total</li>
                                 <ul>
                        <li>clicking 'Next' to get to the following page doesn't submit
                           information or
                           your
                           application</li>
                     </ul>

               <li>Have your attachment files ready to attach to the request on page 6</li>
               <li>On the final page, click the Submit button
                  <ul>
                     <li>You'll receive an immediate message indicating, 'Submission completed successfully'</li>
                  </ul>

            </ul>

            <div class="well">
