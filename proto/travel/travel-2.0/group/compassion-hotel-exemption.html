            <h2>Step 1: Determine if you are eligible for an exemption</h2>
		<p><strong>If you are flying home</strong> after travelling abroad for compassionate reasons, you can apply for an exemption from the mandatory 3-day hotel stopover.</p>

             <p>You can apply if you live in Canada and are a:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Canadian citizen</li>
               <li>person registered under the <cite>Indian Act</cite></li>
               <li>permanent resident</li>
               <li>temporary resident</li>
               <li>protected person</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You must have travelled to a foreign country to:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>be present during the final moments of life for an immediate or extended family member</li>
               <li>provide support to an immediate or extended family member who is deemed to be critically ill by a licensed health care practitioner</li>
               <li>provide care to an immediate or extended family member who is deemed by a licensed health care practitioner to require support for a medical reason</li>
               <li>attend a funeral or end-of-life ceremony</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 2: Complete the solemn declaration attachment</h2>
            <p>Before you start your request for exemption online, you must
               complete a solemn declaration form.</p>
		 <p>The declaration must be signed by a:</p>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Commissioner for Oaths</li>
			 <li>Justice of the peace</li>
			 <li>Lawyer</li>
			 <li>Notary public</li>
			 <li>Consular officer of the Government of Canada</li>
		 </ul>

<p>You must use the template solemn declaration form. We will not accept any other format.</p>
		 <p>Solemn declaration for Residents Returning from Compassionate Travel <mark>LINK PDF OF DOCUMENT</mark></p>
            <p>It's an offence under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite> to provide a false or misleading statement, which
               could lead to up to:</p>

            <ul>
               <li>6 months in prison and/or</li>
               <li>$750,000 in fines</li>

            <p>Your request will not be accepted if it's
               incomplete.</p>
