            from Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon and cargo-only flights remain exempt.</p>

         <p>Scheduled commercial passenger flights arriving from the United States, Mexico, Central America, the
            Caribbean and South America are also required to land at the four airports.</p>

         <h4>Mandatory 3-night hotel stay</h4>

            location first.</p>

         <p>When the new arrival testing measures take effect, you will be required to stop over in the Canadian city in
            which you entered for a mandatory 3-night hotel stay. You must receive a negative test result before

            to go to their suitable place of quarantine.</p>
