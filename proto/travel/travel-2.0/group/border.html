<p><mark>There are many factors that come into play when Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is determining if you are permitted
to enter Canada. It is important to note that the final determination is made by a border services officer at the port
of entry. They base their decision on the information presented to them at the time of entry into Canada.</mark>
</p>

<p><mark>In addition to the temporary entry restriction in place due to COVID-19, you must meet the entry requirements under the
<cite>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</cite> and provide appropriate travel and immigration documentation.</mark></p>

<p>A Border Services Officer will deny you entry unless you are:</p>


<ul>
   <li> a Canadian citizen</li>
   <li> a permanent resident of Canada</li>
   <li> a temporary resident of Canada</li>
   <li> a protected person (refugee status)</li>
   <li> a person registered under the Indian Act or</li>
 <li>a foreign national with a non-discretionary (non-optional) reason to travel to Canada</li>

</ul>
<p>Foreign nationals with symptoms will <strong>not be allowed</strong> to enter Canada.</p>

      <h3>How we screen travellers</h3>
      <p>All travellers are assessed, no matter their country of origin, upon arrival to Canada. Entry screening is one of
         many
         important public health tools. It is part of a multi-layered government response strategy.</p>
      <p>When you arrive in Canada at an air, land, marine or rail border, a Border Services Officer will ask you:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>what the purpose of your visit is</li>
         <li>whether you are feeling ill or unwell</li>
         <li>other questions as needed to complete their assessment</li>
      </ul>
      <p><abbr>CBSA</abbr> officers will look for signs of illness, regardless of how you respond to screening questions.
         Officers will refer any traveller they suspect is ill for a further medical assessment by the Public Health Agency
         of
         Canada.</p>

         <p>All travellers entering Canada are given a Public Health Agency of Canada handout with
         instructions to quarantine for 14 days.</p>

         <p>You <strong>must</strong> wear a <a
            href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html">non-medical
            mask or face covering</a> upon arrival in
            Canada. Masks or face coverings may be provided upon arrival as appropriate.</p>

</ul>

   <h3>False information and compliance with the Emergency Order</h3>
   
   
   <p>Providing false information is <strong>considered misrepresentation</strong> and has consequences. If you provide
      false immigration
      information or false information about the purpose of your travel, you may be denied entry and/or be banned from
      returning to Canada.</p>

            <li>make your travel arrangements to transit through Canada <strong>well in advance</strong></li>
            <li>make flights and connections as direct as possible to limit your contact in Canada; multiple domestic connections
               may not be considered appropriate</li>
            <li>make connections that are as short as possible; if your connecting flight is more than 24 hours apart you will
