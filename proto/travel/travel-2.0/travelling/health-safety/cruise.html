<h2 id="cruise">Avoid all travel on cruise ships</h3>
	<p><strong>Canada advises all travellers to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada, including on cruise ships.</strong></p>
	<p>If an outbreak of COVID-19 were to occur on a cruise ship while you are outside of Canada:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>you could be subject to quarantine procedures onboard ship or in a foreign country</li>
		<li>the range of consular services available to those on cruise ships may be significantly restricted by local
			authorities, especially in situations of quarantine</li>
		<li>it is unlikely that there would be a government-organized repatriation flight to return to Canada
			</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="cruise-ban">Ban on cruise vessels in Canadian waters</h2>
