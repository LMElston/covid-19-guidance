<h2>Filter to find out who is exempt for quarantine, hotel, and testing</h2>
<p>Filter by keywords to find work roles and personal situations that may be exempt from quarantine, or from COVID-19
	testing either before or after your entry into Canada.</p>
<p><strong>Exempt means that you don't have to follow certain requirements</strong>. For example, if you are exempt from
	quarantine, you don't need to quarantine for 14 days after entering Canada or stay at a government-authorized hotel.
