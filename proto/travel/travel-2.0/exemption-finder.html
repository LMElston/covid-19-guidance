<p>There are travel restrictions in place at all border crossings to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by travellers
	entering Canada. If you aren't sure whether these restrictions apply to you, answer a few questions to:<br>
	<a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/wizard-start">Find out if you can enter Canada</a>
</p>
<p>Find out if your work or personal situation are exempt from quarantine or testing requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Exempt means that you don't have to follow certain requirements</strong>. For example, if you are exempt from
	quarantine, you don't need to quarantine for 14 days after entering Canada or stay at a government-authorized hotel.
</p>

<h2>Filter to find out who is exempt for quarantine, hotel, and testing</h2>
<p>Filter by keywords to find work roles and personal situations that may be exempt from quarantine, or from COVID-19
	testing either before or after your entry into Canada.</p>
<!--<p>Follow the links for your situation or role to check the details for exemptions. For some, you must be performing
	work within a certain amount of time, or be providing a very specific type of service.</p>
