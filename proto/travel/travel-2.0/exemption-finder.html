<p>You may be exempt from mandatory testing and quarantine requirements, under certain conditions <strong>when you enter

	quarantine because your trip is to perform an essential service, you wouldn't be required to quarantine for 14 days
	after entering Canada.</p>

					<li>You live in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, Canada and cross daily to attend school in Sault Ste
						Marie, Michigan, U.S. Your parent drives you to school and picks you up every day. You are both
						exempt from pre-arrival testing, quarantine and arrival testing.</li>
					<li>You attend school in British Columbia and stay in residence during the school week. You went
						home to the U.S. for the weekend and your parent drives you back to school. You and your parent
						are not exempt from testing or quarantine because you are not crossing the border regularly to
						attend school.</li>
					<li>You attend school in Montreal, Quebec, Canada for the year. Your parent enters Canada at the
						beginning of May to bring you home to the U.S. for the summer. Your parent is not exempt from
						testing or quarantine because you are not crossing the border regularly to attend school. The
						driver is only exempt if the student is exempt.</li>
