               <p><mark>Say what % use the wizard and how successful.</mark></p>
               <p>The wizard is a <strong>series of web pages with questions</strong> to help someone determine what to do to enter Canada, or if they can't enter Canada.</p>
               <p>The wizard answers should be as complete as possible information on every answer page. However, it links outside of itself for a few necessary reasons:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>link to applications processes (study permit, worker permit, etc.) </li>
                  <li>link to instructions for quarantine or isolate</li>
                  <li>find provincial and territorial restrictions</li>
                  <li>look at the exact OIC wording for their entry choice, if they want to clarity something</li>

               </ol>
               <p>Links should be limited to the "What you need to do next" steps whenever possible.</p>

              <p>How to design good wizard questions and choices:</p>

               <ul class="lst-spcd">
                  <li>use plain and simple language first to help people navigate, and then introduce OIC language as needed when they get there</li>
                  <li>the goal of wizard options are to <strong>help people choose</strong>, then explain all the details and steps</li>
                  <li>start wizard choices with keywords whenever possible to make it easier to scan</li>
                  <li>choices should be ordered specific to general, because people stop reading when they see what feels like the right choice. For example, if "return home" is ahead of "crossing the border is essential to everday life", many will pick "return home" and not scan the full list since it resonates with them first</li>
                  <li>avoid and reduce redundant text in wizard choices when possible (for example: receiving essential medical services or treatments (for a condition other than COVID-19). Consider the choices that came before (chosing that you do not have COVID symptoms), and consider the text that is, or can be, in the answer. The text "for a condition other than COVID-19" as a wizard choice could be considered redundant in the choice option text)</li>
                  <li>don't put caveats or too many details in wizard choices, they limit choices for someone planning or understanding entry conditions (let them find out when they get to the answer if it's yes or no for their situation)</li>
                  <li>use examples where they will help, such as for someone who's first language may not be English (for example: temporary foreign workers include the most common groups using data from StatCan, and the higher-skilled and IEC examples ensure they associate themselves with this choice)</li>
                  <li>if a choice is best handled in a sensitive way by recognizing the emotions involved ensure there is a tangible meaning (for example: "funerals" and "sitting vigil" as examples for the emotion grief or loss or compassion)</li>
                  <li>use carefully worded choices to help people understand when things are complex, confusing, or don't match what people expect the meaning to be (immediate family)</li>
                  <li>avoid definitions or footnotes in wizard questions unless there is no other way, the questions and choices themselves should eliminate the need whenever possible</li>
                  <!-- <li>keep answer language as clear and precise as possible, be aware that words like "may" or "in most circumstances" or "not likely" will drive up calls unless these situations are explained in ways people understand</li> -->
                  <li>80% rule, focus your efforts on top tasks first. Make sure the wizard handles the primary reasons for entry really
                     well. Accept that the wizard can't answer everything for everyone's unique situation, but you're freeing up the phonelines for those who do have to call for more complex things</li>
               </ul>

               <h2 id="3">Designing answers templates:</h2>

               <h3>Application processes in answers</h3>

               <p>Generally, you do not need to include details or explainations of any entry application processes in the answer pages that you are linking to as a next step.</p>
               
               <p>The exception would be if the application process, language, or instructions are confusing, and cannot be fixed at the source due to legal language requirements. The answer could be crafted to include a plain language summary to aide comprehension and prepare people before they begin.</p>
          
               <h3>Sample templates</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li><a href="citizen-template.html">citizen without symptoms template</a></li>
                  <li><a href="foreign-template.html">foreign national without symptoms template</a></li>
               </ul>

               <h2 id="4">Using alerts when an OIC changes:</h2>
               <ol class="lst-spcd">
                  <li>Add a generic alert when a new OIC is in effect on the affected answer pages only. Expect call volume to be temporarily higher. A generic alert should not be up for longer than <strong>5 business days</strong>.</li>
                 <li>Update to a specific alert once web content and instructions become available. Reduce calls and email volume again, because it is now possible to find online. This step can be skipped if wizard answer can be updated within 5 days. If you update a generic alert to become a specific alert, it can remain for an additional <strong>5 business days</strong> while the answer is designed.</li>
                 <li>Remove alert once answer has been properly incorporated into the wizard</li>
               </ol>

               <p>How to use alerts:</p>
               <ul class="lst-spcd">
                  <li><a href="../alert-demos/foreign-US-trans-border-generic.html">generic change alert</a> (most of the answer still applies, so the answer instructions remain on the page. If the answer instructions have completely changed, they should be removed)</li>
                  <li><a href="../alert-demos/foreign-transit-land-press-release.html">specific change alert</a> (entry is possible, and there is updated web content with instructions that can be linked to. There are no detailed answer instructions on the page in order not to confuse people with old content)</li>
                  <li><a href="../alert-demos/foreign-non-US-not-travel-exempt-no-wizard-choice.html">wizard logic change</a> (if a new group(s) of traveller(s) is permitted to enter, use an alert on the "none of the above" or "no entry" type answers to inform travellers. Instruct them to call (or link to web content with instructions) if they fall into the new group(s) to find out what to do)</li>
               </ul>

               <p>Don't use alerts:</p>
                  <ul class="lst-spcd">
                     <li>to put warnings in the questions (logic flow)</li>
                     <li>as a replacement for easily updated answer (such as entry being no longer permitted for a group, or a simple update to entry criteria like a single bullet point, or single sentence of content to update)</li>
                     <li>to put an info message about what was updated in the answer</li>
                  </ul>

               <h2 id="5">When to create an additional choice in existing question options</h2>

               <p>Choices can share the same answer as another choice, but only if the are an exact match in information. This is used when choices are different things in order to help people make the choice they need to, but they loop back to being exactly the same answer (such as the "reasons for entry that require quarantine" for citizens, and the "no entry permitted" answers for foreign citizens).</p>

               <ul class="lst-spcd">
                  <li>Yes: The current choices don't show an obvious path forward
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: (in discussion right now) organ donors have no obvious path. It's likely they would choose "receiving medical treatment" choice in Q3b, Q4b (can they come in from non-U.S. ?) Does this answer accurately inform them? Does the caveat of the XH period apply to them? If not, they need their own radio and answer. (In the end, we ruled that organ donors were an interpretation of the OIC by PHAC, and CBSA denies them entry from non-US - so it's best to leave any interpretations out and stick to clear-cut OIC)</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Yes: They're related in the OIC, but people think of them as different entry reasons.
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: **thoughts about compassionate shared with PHAC/EO team already**</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: A current choice can be modified slightly to include the new choice
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: Add "marine-research" to fishing choice. The answer for marine research follows the same
                           rules as research fishing-related activities. Any specific caveat for marine research
                           could be an expand-collapse in the answer.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: It's simple and reasonable to combine the choices
                     <ul>
                     <li>For example: "national interest" and "invited to assist with COVID-19" are one choice since the answers are an exact match of information (it's a simple page with minimal text) and not a likely audience for the wizard.</li>

                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: It is an edge case (very uncommon scenario)
                     <ul>
                        <li>Edge cases are handled by the "rescue" answers. For example, "none of the above" or the "other". These provide opportunities for rescue links for the edge cases to find their answer in the supporting pages. This makes the wizard easier to maintain.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/travel/routing-updates/group/wizard-v2/answers/foreign-non-US-possible-essential.html">non-U.S. possible essential work</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/travel/routing-updates/group/wizard-v2/answers/foreign-US-work-not-optional.html">U.S. work not optional</a></li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <h2 id="6">When to create a new answer page</h2>


               <ul class="lst-spcd">
                  <li>Yes: Answers should be specific, especially for top tasks. If a choice has information that is different for the caveat about entry or the steps to follow, it needs a separate answer.</li>
                  <li>No: An answer page exists already that matches entry conditions 1 to 1.
                     <ul><li>For example: "non-U.S. medical treatment" has been corrected to be a "not travel exempt reason". Many calls have been documented concerning medical entry, so this choice radio choice should remain here so they can find out they can't enter. However, the answer and the explanation is the same as any other "optional reason" and the choices can share the same answer.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>No: An exisiting answer page just needs a small modification
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: Cross-border students do not need their own answer page. There is <strong>also</strong> an expand-collapse on the trans-border community answer and in the U.S. students answer. They will relate to one of those choices and find the correct information. If cross-border students are better answered in the trans-border community answer, such as not often being subject to needing study permits, or have to attend an approved DLIs, then it would be better to create more scent of information to the choice for trans-border communites. For example, "crossing the border is essential to every day functions (cross border employment, cross border students, an integrated border community, etc.)" - you can put examples of the top-most transcommunity answers in short form.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: Don't create extra pages to maintain that have no real value
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: having each immediate family member have its own answer page, just for the sake of having "You indicated
                           you are the spouse of the person" in the list</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>


               <h2 id="7">When to create an additional question for logic</h2>
               <p>Questions should guide someone in a simple and direct manner to their answer. Ask only as many as are needed.</p>

               <ul class="lst-spcd">
                  <li>Yes: An additional question would remove complexity from an answer page that would otherwise have a large number of caveats and instructions (and can be answered by a simple follow-up yes, no or multiple choice question).
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example: (totally imagined fake scenario) 
                           <br>If non-U.S. entry wildlife biologists could enter Canada, but only if they are researching 5 particular Canadian species, they have to fly in on a Monday, and there's a list of approved equipment they must be using. In this imagined scenario, there are a lot of caveats.
                           <br><strong>Wizard choice work (Q4c)</strong>:<br>
                           • wildlife biologist (this choice has no caveats, we let the follow up question and answers handle the needed clarity)
                           <br><strong>Follow up question</strong>:
                           <br>Which of the following species is your primary subject of study? (Of these caveats, this one is appropriate as a question to ask because it specifically concerns a reason for entry that is not likely something that can be changed by the traveller. Other examples: citizenship status, family status)
                           <br><strong>Answer choices</strong>:<br>
                            The 5 valid species by scientific name, and "none of the above" (If they choose a species they are permitted entry to study, they can likely adjust their travel plans to meet the entry conditions of <strong>flying in on Sunday</strong> and <strong>use approved equipment</strong>. If not, they will be denied entry and get a clear answer as to why.)
                           <br><strong>Intro text caveat (1b)</strong>:
                           <br>You will likely be allowed to enter Canada, but you must enter by plane on a Monday and use only the approved equipment.
                           <br><strong>Entry caveat explained (1c)</strong>: 
                           <br>[Bullet list of the approved equipment you must be using]
                           <br><strong>Next steps (2)</strong>:
                           <br>• Plan your flight to Canada so that you will arrive on a Monday. <br> • Bring only approved equipment.
                        </li>
                     </ul>

                  </li>
                  
                  <li>Yes: There is a new answer for a specific group who have specific steps of their own to take (and can be answered by a simple follow-up yes, no or multiple choice question)
                     <ul><li>For example: Ask a foreigners with symptoms if they are seeking refugee status (this could also be an expand-collapse caveat in the "foreign-symptoms" option, however, it is much better to craft an answer with the steps for entry)</li></ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Caution: Asking a follow up question for something very simple that already fits into the answer introduction (1 or 1.b) and "What you need to do next" (2).
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: non-U.S. students could have a follow up question asking when their permit was approved. We decided not to because it's very simple as introductory text, and a "What to do next step". If we asked someone that question prior to the answer, it becomes repetitive to repeat it in the answer page, so then the date of the permit should become part of the "You indicated" only section. This is where monitoring wizard feedback comes into play and listening to what CBSA is experiencing at the border, and running your own tests. Fix what you know isn't working or not clear enough, and leave what works very well alone (80% or higher success rates in performances) </li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Caution: Don't use a question to create unnecessary complexity
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: We don't currently ask a technican or specialist in critical infrastructure which sector they work in, and have an answer page for
                           the sectors (or each sector its own answer) and 1 answer page (none of the above) to deny them entry and explain why. However, if CBSA reports, or wizard feedback data indicates technicans or specialists are making mistakes based on not properly identifying their sectors for critical infrastructure using this tool, this would then be a necessary change to improve the content</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: If the answer has an entry caveat, but it requires a written explanation to understand and cannot be a simple yes, no, or multiple choice answer.
                     <ul>For example: Students cannot be expected to answer a question if their entry is necessary (not optional) or part of a listed institution without knowing what that means or seeing the list. Let them read it in the answer and see what they must do or prove in order to enter</ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: Don't use a question to clarify a choice already made
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: If someone chooses they are a temporary foreign worker, don't ask if they have applied for a permit as a follow up question. While of course the permit is relevant to entry, they already made the choice of currently being a TFW. The answer reminds them to be aware their documents must be in order</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                
                  
               
               </ul>
