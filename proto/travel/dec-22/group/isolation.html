                <p>Quarantine or isolation is mandatory for people entering Canada.</p>
                <p>Quarantine and isolation plans are evaluated by government representative at the border to determine
                    whether they’re suitable. This includes the risk to public health and the health and safety of those
                    staying at the place of quarantine.</p>

                <p>The Government of Canada has put in place an <a

                    It applies to all travellers arriving in Canada. Its purpose is to slow the spread of
                    COVID-19 in Canada.
                </p>

                <h3>Consequences for failure to comply with the Emergency Order</h3>

                <p>Failure to comply with this order is an offence under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite> and could lead
                    to <strong>imprisonment and/or fines</strong>.</p>

                <p>First, you should determine whether or not you can enter Canada.</p>
                <a href="./wizard-start.html" class="btn btn-call-to-action">Find out if you can travel to Canada</a>


                <p>If you can enter Canada and <strong>you have no symptoms</strong>, you must
                    <strong>quarantine</strong> for 14 days. This is mandatory and starts from the date you arrive in
                    Canada. A <strong>negative</strong> COVID-19 test result at any point during your quarantine does
                    not exclude you from the requirement to quarantine, unless you are part of an approved federal and
                    provincial quarantine project.
                </p>

                <p>Should you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 during quarantine, you must begin isolation
                    for an additional
                    14 days from the date of your positive COVID-19 test or the date your symptoms started.</p>
                <h3 id="plan">Your quarantine plan</h3>

                <p>As a traveller, you <strong>must</strong> demonstrate that you have an adequate plan for quarantine.
                    You are expected to make plans, within your own means, in advance of your arrival at ports of entry
                    to Canada. <strong>Foreign nationals</strong> who do not have an adequate plan may be denied entry
                    into Canada.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You must quarantine in a place where you won't have contact with people who:
                            <ul>
                                <li>are 65 years or older</li>
                                <li>have underlying medical conditions</li>
                                <li>have a compromised immune system</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You'll need access to the basic necessities of life, including water, food and medication
                            without leaving quarantine, and heat during the winter months</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>You may only quarantine with somebody from the above group if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>they consent to the quarantine or are the parent or minor in a parent-minor relationship
                        </li>
                        <li>you complete a form provided by a government representative at the port of entry explaining
                            the consent and
                            receive authorization to proceed</li>
                    </ul>


                    </ul>


                    <p>Many travellers will be able to quarantine at home or at their Canadian destination.</p>

                    <p>Some travellers may be unable to quarantine at home or their final destination. In these cases,
                        travellers are expected to
                        make alternative arrangements for their return to Canada. Although alternative accommodations
                        (e.g. with family or
                        friends, or paid accommodation) may be suitable, the Government of Canada does not reimburse for
                        expenses incurred for
                        accommodations, including hotels, RV rentals and trailer park or campground fees.</p>


                    <h4>You cannot quarantine in group living environments</h4>
                    <p>Some examples include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>industrial camps</li>
                        <li>construction trailers</li>

                        work with them
                        to confirm that
                        all other options for quarantine accommodations within their own means have been exhausted.</p>


                    <p>These facilities are a <strong>last resort</strong> for travellers who have no options of
                        meeting quarantine requirements by other means.</p>
                    <p>Where required, transportation from the port of entry to a federal quarantine facility is

                        care for someone, or for an end of life visitation)</summary>
                    <p>Based on your reason for travel, you may apply for a limited release from quarantine for
                        compassionate reasons. If
                        you’re approved, your limited release from quarantine is valid only for the location(s) and
                        purpose specified in your
                        application.</p>

                    <p>Some provinces and territories may not allow for limited release from quarantine for
                        compassionate reasons. This means
                        that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada a province or
                        territory may have additional
                        restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and
                        provincial or territorial travel
                        restrictions, you must comply with those that are the most stringent.</p>

<details><summary>How to request a letter of interpretation</summary>

<p id="request-ex">If you would like to request a letter of interpretation that provides an assessment as to whether your <strong>future</strong> travels <strong>may</strong> qualify for an exemption under one of the Emergency Orders under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>, please submit your request in writing to the Public Health Agency of Canada at: <a href="mailto:phac.emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca"
    target="_blank">emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca</a>.
</p>



<p>Note that there is currently a high volume of requests, and response times are delayed. <strong>Submit your request well in advance</strong> of your travel dates, as it can take up to a month or more to receive a response. </p>

<p>The response email may be presented to the government representative at the port of entry during <strong>your next crossing</strong> to facilitate their decision as to whether an exemption applies in your case. </p>

<p> To support a thorough analysis, include the following information, at minimum:</p>
<ul>
    <li>number of travellers and country of citizenship of each traveller</li>
    <li>planned travel dates/frequency of travel</li>
    <li>specific purpose for travel to Canada</li>
    <li>an explanation as to why you believe your travel to Canada qualifies for an exemption under the Emergency Orders. Include any relevant information to support the explanation. <strong>Do not include any personal or sensitive information</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for the development of the Emergency Orders pursuant to the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>, government representatives are responsible for administering the Emergency Orders at Canada’s ports of entry. </p>
<p>As such, permission to enter Canada, or exemption from quarantine, is granted by a government representative, who is required to consider the information provided at the time of entry to determine whether a person should be permitted entry into Canada, or be exempt from quarantine. This includes reviewing travel documentation (for example, a valid passport and work permit, a letter of invitation from an employer), the quarantine plan for the arriving traveller, and any relevant exemptions.</p>
<p>A letter of interpretation from PHAC would be taken into account, but would not guarantee entry or exemption from quarantine requirements.
