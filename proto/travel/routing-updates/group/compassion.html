   <h2 id="fn-compassion">Foreign nationals applying for compassionate entry</h2>

<p>All Foreign nationals <strong>must apply</strong> for and receive written approval for compassionate entry in order to enter
   Canada. Without this advanced approval, you will likely be <strong>denied entry</strong>.</p>

<p>You can apply to enter for the following compassionate reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be present during the final moments of life for a loved one</li>
<li>to provide support to a person who is critically ill as determined by a licensed health care practitioner
in Canada</li>
<li>to provide care to a person who has a medical reason as determined by a licensed health care practitioner in
Canada</li>
<li>to attend a funeral or end of life ceremony</li>

</ul>

   <p>The person you will care for, visit at end of life, or attend the funeral of must reside in Canada and be either:
   </p>

<ul>
   <li>a Canadian citizen</li>
   <li>a permanent resident of Canada</li>
   <li>a temporary resident of Canada</li>
   <li>a protected person <strong>or</strong></li>
   <li>a person registered under the <cite>Indian Act</cite></li>
</ul>
</details>






<h3>Limited (temporary) release from quarantine</h3>
<p>If required, you can request a limited release from quarantine as part of your compassionate entry application.</p>
<p>Some provinces and territories may not allow for limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons. This means
that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada a province or territory may have additional
restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and provincial or territorial travel
restrictions, you must comply with those that are the most stringent.</p>

<p>Before applying, please check provincial or territorial requirements and check back often to find out if any of their
quarantine requirements prohibit limited release from quarantine.</p>
