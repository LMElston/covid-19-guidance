 <p>This section considers how each Budget 2021 measure affects Canadians—both who is most affected and the nature of the impacts at a high level. </p> <p>
 The <em>Canadian Gender Budgeting Act</em> was passed by Parliament in December 2018, enshrining the government’s commitment to decision-making that takes into account the impacts of policies on all types of Canadians. The Act legislated the government’s commitment to publish information on the gender and diversity impacts of all new budget measures. Starting in Budget 2019, the government’s budget documents have included analysis of the impacts of individual budget measures, providing transparency into the analysis that is performed as part of the policy development and budgeting processes. This analysis continues to be a work in progress, and is often limited by the availability of data, especially for certain identity factors such as race, gender identity, and disability. But under the leadership of the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development, the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, and the Minister of Middle Class Prosperity and Associate Minister of Finance, departments continue to work at modernizing and improving the quality of this analysis, with particular attention to the intersectional analysis of race, Indigeneity, disability, and gender identity. These insights were instrumental in informing the development and evolution of the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. Going forward, new Budget 2021 investments in Statistics Canada should help improve Canadians’ access to disaggregated data.</p>
 <p>

 Reflecting the feedback of experts who have been advising the Department of Finance Canada on its gender budgeting practices on a periodic basis, this report devotes more space to measures that are more relevant from a gender and diversity standpoint, while ensuring a basic level of coverage for all budget measures. Budget 2021 measures which are expected to advance the Gender Results Framework are placed at the beginning of this report. </p><p>

 This report is also expanded this year to contain additional information on the <em>nature</em> of the impacts expected from each budget measure, reflecting the government’s commitment to better incorporate quality of life measurements into decision-making and budgeting. As outlined in <u><em>Measuring what Matters</em></u>, the government is beginning to track progress on a range of fronts to ensure that priorities and decision-making are based on evidence of what will most improve current and future Canadians’ quality of life. As an illustration of initial steps in that direction, this report includes information on how individual budget measures advance various dimensions and indicators of the draft quality of life framework.

	 <h2>Notes on Terms and Fields </h2>




 <p><strong>Title and Context:</strong> Each title is linked with its corresponding entry in the budget text. Click the title of a GBA+ to view the description of the measure. </p>

 <p><strong>Text section:</strong> contains information on the key impacts of the measures from a gender and diversity and quality of life perspective, including direct and indirect impacts, both positive and negative, where applicable. Key facts and data sources are included in this section.</p>

 <p><strong>GBA+ Timing:</strong> GBA+ can be conducted at various stages throughout the development of a government policy, program, or initiative. High-quality GBA+ requires early attention to develop effective options and strategies for delivering programs and services to Canadians. For GBA+ to be most valuable, it is ideally built directly into the early stages of the policy development process. This section identifies when the GBA+ was conducted.</p>

	 <p><strong>Gender Results Framework (if applicable): </strong> For measures that advance a goal or objective of Canada’s Gender Results Framework (GRF), an icon and associated GRF pillar is listed. Although only gender is included in the title of the Framework, it is aligned with the Government of Canada’s policy of GBA+, ensuring that gender is considered in relation to other intersecting identity factors. Additionally, a measure may advance more than one goal under one or more pillars; however, in this report, only the primary pillar is listed.

 and Connect with Employers </h3></summary>

 <p><span>Investments in
 youth employment and job skills training will directly benefit youth (ages
 15-30), including vulnerable youth facing multiple barriers to employment and
 groups under-represented in the labour market such as racialized and Indigenous
 youth, women in certain skilled trades, as well as some newcomers to Canada. It
 is also expected that young women will see slightly more benefit than men, as
 young women have been disproportionately economically affected by the pandemic
 compared to other demographics, including experiencing higher rates of job
 loss.</span></p>

                <summary><h3>Opportunities for Businesses and Young
 Workers Through Mitacs</h3></summary>

 <p>This program directly benefits youth since it will expand
 the number of work-integrated learning opportunities for post-secondary
 students. It will also directly benefit businesses that get access to
 highly-qualified individuals. As Mitacs’ internships tend to focus on science,
 technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, in which men are
 overrepresented, it is likely that men would benefit more than women from these
 opportunities. Relative to their share of the labour force, visible minorities
 are also more likely to work in STEM fields. Women make up only 34 per cent of
 STEM bachelor degree holders and men account for 53 per cent of college
 enrolments in STEM programs. Men are also more highly-represented among
 Canadian business owners. </p>

 Opportunities for Skilled Tradespeople</h3></summary>

 <p><span>This program
 will disproportionately benefit young men as they are overrepresented in most
 Red Seal trades. 53 per cent of apprentices are under 25 years of age,
 86&nbsp;per cent are men, 91 per cent are Canadian-born, and 56 per cent had a
 high school diploma as their highest level of education when starting an
 apprenticeship. Women comprised about 14 per cent of apprentices overall, and fewer
 women than men apprentices were registered in a Red Seal trade (59 per cent
 versus 81 per cent). Across the top 10 Red Seal trades, women were more likely
 than men to be hairstylists or cook apprentices. However, the number of women
 entering an apprenticeship program in a male-dominated trade (e.g. carpentry,
 electrical) has more than doubled in the last decade. Indigenous apprentices
 comprised about six per cent of apprentices overall, while immigrants comprised
 about nineper cent apprentices overall.</span></p>

 Workers</h3></summary>

 <p><span>This program is expected to benefit men
 and women relatively equally, with benefits accruing differently depending on the
 specific projects and sectors supported. Projects in the health sector are
 likely to disproportionately benefit women, as they currently hold 80 per cent
 of jobs in the sector. Projects in the energy sector are likely to benefit men
 disproportionately, as women make up 22 per cent of the energy production
 workforce, 55 per cent of which are in business administration or accounting. </span></p>

 <p><span>This program directly targets low and

 and choose to return to post-secondary education on a full-time basis. Adult
 students face significant financial pressures related to housing costs,

 languages and an increase in training and bilingualism will improve employment
 opportunities for young Canadians, especially for those living in remote or
 rural communities. Post-secondary institutions train the bilingual workforce
 required for the vitality of official language minority communities and the
 promotion of bilingualism, such as French-language teachers and early childhood
 educators. As women make up 70 per cent of education services, they are
 expected to indirectly benefit. Investments will also support jobs in

 <p>These investments will benefit Indigenous students, the
 majority of whom are young women. Women have historically made up approximately
 69&nbsp;per cent of students funded through the Post-Secondary Student Support
 Program. Post-secondary education attainment rates of Indigenous people are
 approximately 18 per cent lower than those of their non-Indigenous counterparts,
 and COVID-19 interruptions risk accelerating these inequalities. Obtaining a
 post-secondary qualification can have a significant positive impact. In 2016,
 the employment rate for the First Nations population living on reserve with no
 certificate, diploma or degree was
 33 per cent. This increased to 49 per cent for those with a high school diploma
 or equivalent, and again to 65 per cent for those who had attained a
 post-secondary certificate, diploma or degree. Indigenous-led post-secondary
 institutions also preserve and strengthen Indigenous languages and cultures.</p>

 <p>CanCode has a focus on reaching girls, Indigenous youth,
 youth with disabilities, and youth living in rural, remote, and northern
 communities to increase their representation in science, technology,
 engineering, and mathematics training. </p>

 <p>About seven per cent of Canadians under the age of 24 are
 Indigenous and, in CanCode’s first three years, between 6 and 9 per cent of
 participants have been Indigenous youth. Between 45 and 49 per cent of CanCode
 participants were girls, consistent with their 48.6&nbsp;per cent share of the
 school-aged population. </p>

 <p>About 19 per cent of Canadians live in rural areas, and
 between 16 and 20 per cent of CanCode participants were youth living in rural
 areas. About 4 per cent of the population aged 15 to 24 report having a
 disability, compared with between one and 2.5 per cent of CanCode recipients.</p>

 <p><span>This measure primarily targets parents
 with young children, particularly mothers who often retain primary caregiving
 responsibilities. It will also be of particular benefit to early childhood
 educators, 96 per cent of whom are women.</span></p>

 <p><span>Women, particularly those with young
 children, have lower labour market participation rates than men. In 2019, only
 83&nbsp;per cent of women between the ages of 25 and 44 participated in
 the labour force, whereas men in the same age range participated at a rate of
 91 per cent. Young women with children are at higher risk of not being in
 education, employment or training. Access to affordable early learning and
 child care will increase women’s labour market participation and shrink the
 gender participation gap as more mothers enter the workforce.</span></p>

 <p><span>Families of all income ranges will see
 reduction in fees. Funding for a Canada-wide early learning and child care
 system will also support efforts to attract and retain high-quality early
 childhood educators, who are predominantly women and face challenges such as
 low wages, poor working conditions, and a lack of career advancement
 opportunities. </span></p>

 <p><span>There is significant research that shows
 high-quality child care supports positive child development outcomes such as
 improved cognition and social skills, particularly among children from
 disadvantaged families. </span></p>

 <p>This investment will benefit Indigenous women, children,
 and families by increasing opportunities for labour force participation and
 reducing unpaid caregiving time use pressures, contributing to healthy child
 development, and benefiting workers in the sector. The labour market impacts of
 COVID-19 have had a deeper and longer-lasting impact on Indigenous people.
 Employment among Indigenous women, in particular, remains below pre-pandemic
 levels.</p>

 <p>Access to flexible, high quality child care has been shown
 to increase participation in work, education or training by
 parents—particularly mothers—and could play a role in addressing these
 disparities. </p>

 <p>First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children are more likely
 to live in poverty compared to the overall Canadian average. Access to high
 quality, culturally relevant programming will help improve school readiness,
 long-term development, and life outcomes, and empower young children with a
 strong sense of identity. </p>

 <p>These investments will also benefit Indigenous early
 childhood educators, who are overwhelmingly women, by allowing child care
 providers to raise wages, provide upskilling opportunities, and create training
 programs and jobs for new entrants.</p>

                <summary><h3>Strengthening Long-Term Care and
 Supportive Care</h3></summary>

 <p><span>The pandemic has disproportionately
 affected the long-term and supportive care sectors in Canada. Over 2,500 care
 homes experienced an outbreak between March 1, 2020, and February 15, 2021,
 resulting in the deaths of over 14,000 residents and close to 30 staff. This
 represents more than two-thirds of Canada’s overall COVID-19 deaths. About
 80,000 residents and staff of LTC and retirement homes have been infected,
 representing 10 per cent of all COVID-19 cases in Canada. </span></p>

 <p>This funding directly benefits seniors and persons with
 disabilities who require long-term care and supportive care. Women are expected
 to particularly benefit as 65 per cent of patients in residential continuing
 care facilities are women. </p>

 <p>Health care providers, particularly personal support
 workers, and informal caregivers are also expected to benefit from the
 additional work and improved working conditions created through this funding.
 The vast majority of care providers in supportive care are women, with a
 significant portion of these individuals being newcomers or immigrants,
 especially among personal support workers. </p>

 <p>Of the 245,500 people employed as nurse aides, orderlies
 and patient service associates in Canada in 2016, more than a third (87,925)
 were immigrants. Women accounted for the majority of these workers among both
 immigrants (86 per cent) and non-immigrants (87 per cent).</p>

 <p>Approximately 10 per cent of Canadians have a criminal
 record. This initiative is expected to facilitate their reintegration into
 society. This measure will primarily benefit men, who in 2018-19, represented
 87 per cent of those admitted to correctional facilities. Groups that are
 overrepresented in the criminal justice system are also expected to directly
 benefit, including Indigenous peoples, who account for 30 per cent of
 admissions to federal custody, while only accounting for five per cent of the
 Canadian population, as well as Black Canadians, who account for 7.2 per cent
 of federal inmates despite representing 3.5 per cent of Canadians. </p>

 <p>In addition, the reduction of the application fee and
 funding for community support services will increase accessibility to pardons,
 particularly for lower‑income and marginalized applicants. More broadly,
 this measure will benefit not only applicants, but society in general. For
 example, Canadians who obtain a pardon are more likely to gain employment and
 suitable housing. </p>

 <p>The renewed program will fund social purpose organizations
 (e.g. charities, non-profits, social enterprises) to advance a broad range of
 socio-economic objectives for diverse populations. The program is committed to
 providing equitable access to all Canadian social purpose organizations, and it
 will build on partnerships with organizations such the Canadian Women’s
 Foundation and National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association to support
 social purpose organizations facing barriers in accessing social financing,
 such as those led by or serving women, Indigenous people, and more. The renewed
 program will strengthen employment opportunities for women, Indigenous people,
 persons with disabilities, Black Canadians, LGBTQ2, and other marginalized
 groups to support a more inclusive and diverse workforce.</p>

 <p><span>Personal support workers are often
 captured under the occupational categories of nurse aides, orderlies and
 patient service associates. The 2016 Census indicates that 86&nbsp;per cent of these
 front-line care providers were women and more than one-third were immigrants
 (compared to one-quarter of all other occupations). This sub-group was also
 more likely to identify as a visible minority (34 per cent) than workers in
 other occupations (21 per cent), with Black and Filipino women especially
 overrepresented. While the initiative is preliminarily assessed as mainly
 benefiting women, my 65+ is open to both Service Employees International Union’s

 <p><span>Funding will allow Telefilm Canada to
 continue to support audiovisual production excellence in Canada by modernizing
 its current suite of programs in response to increasing digitization in the
 audiovisual sector and global demand for content. In addition, targeted funding
 for Telefilm Canada and the Canada Media Fund will be used to directly benefit
 underrepresented professionals in the industry, including women, people with
 disabilities, LGBTQ2, people of colour, Black, and Indigenous creators. Women,
 especially women of colour and Indigenous women, continue to be
 underrepresented across most jobs in film and television production in Canada.
 Women of colour represent less than one per cent of TV writing roles and five
 per cent of directing roles. While women make up more than half of arts and
 culture workers generally in Canada, they continue to earn a lower average
 hourly rate than men who work in the sector. </span></p>

 <p><span>The impact of COVID-19 on the tourism
 sector has been most acute among underrepresented groups, as the sector employs
 a large number of women, youth, Indigenous peoples, immigrants, and LGBTQ2
 Canadians. For example, women occupy 51.4 per cent of total jobs in the tourism
 sector, compared to 48.2 per cent across all industries, while youth make up
 30.7 per cent compared to 12.7 per cent, and Indigenous persons occupy 4.1 per
 cent of jobs in the sector compared to 3.7&nbsp;per cent of all
 employment. Tourism businesses are more likely to be owned by underrepresented
 groups than those in other sectors. For example, 30 per cent of businesses in
 the tourism sector are fully owned by women, versus 16 per cent of businesses
 in the broader economy. </span></p>

 <p><span>The announced tourism measures are
 designed to benefit the most affected groups in the sector and rural
 communities dependent on tourism. The economic stimulus impacts of this
 spending will benefit all Canadians.</span></p>

 Financing Program</h3></summary>

 <p><span>Current data from Statistics Canada
 indicates that 63.5 per cent of small and medium enterprises are owned by men.
 This measure is expected to have a direct positive impact on women and indirect
 positive impacts on diverse and disadvantaged groups. These positive impacts
 are largely as a result of changes to eligibility to extend lending to non-profit
 and charitable social enterprises. Women account for more than 75 per cent of
 employment in the non-profit sector. Youth are also expected to benefit as 41
 per cent of Canada Small Business Financing program borrowers are under 40
 years old, compared to 16 per cent of small and medium sized businesses at
 large. </span></p>

 reduce potential barriers in the public service staffing process for employment
 equity and equity-seeking groups including women, Indigenous peoples, persons

 may have trouble meeting education requirements due to systemic barriers and
 limited access to higher education, particularly in remote geographical
 locations. Similarly, new arrivals to Canada, who are more likely to be members
 of a visible minority, may have trouble meeting certification requirements due
 to the time and challenges associated with having foreign credentials
 recognized.</span></p>

                <summary><h3>Advancing a National Action Plan to End
 Gender-Based Violence</h3></summary>

 <p><span>These investments will directly benefit
 women and girls, in particular women and girls with disabilities, Black,
 Indigenous and racialized women and girls, and LGBTQ2 people, groups that are
 at a significantly higher risk of experiencing gender-based violence. These
 groups also face increased barriers in accessing supports and services due to
 systemic inequalities, such as sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism and
 poverty. COVID-19 has further amplified inequalities and gender-based violence,
 disproportionately affecting women with lower incomes. </span></p>

 <p><span>Almost half of all female homicide
 victims are killed by an intimate partner, compared to six per cent for male
 victims. Sexual assault is a gendered crime that is far more likely to target
 women, especially young women. In 2017, the rate of police-reported violent
 crimes in Canada was higher for girls and young women aged 24 and younger
 compared to their male counterparts (1,394 versus 1,030 incidents per 100,000
 population). According to Statistics Canada, the rate of sexual assault is not
 declining, with police-reported sexual assaults increasing every year from 2015
 to 2019. </span></p>

 <p>Indigenous women are more likely to be affected by all
 types of violent victimization with the homicide rate for Indigenous women and
 girls nearly seven times higher than amongst non-Indigenous women and girls in
 2019. When taking into account all risk factors, LGBTQ2 Canadians are twice as
 likely to experience violent victimization as non-LGBTQ2 Canadians. </p>

 Violence in the Military</h3></summary>

 <p><span>These
 measures will directly benefit people who have experienced sexual misconduct
 and gender-based violence in the military by enhancing support services to
 victims, increasing the availability of resources for recovery, and enhancing external
 oversight of the Canadian Armed Forces. </span></p>

 <p><span>Primarily,
 these measures will directly benefit women, as women in the Canadian Armed Forces
 are 2.5 times to 3 times more likely to experience sexual misconduct than men. Additional
 or specialized support will also be provided for LGBTQ2 members that have
 experienced sexual misconduct and gender-based violence in the military.</span></p>

 <p><span>In addition,
 men will benefit from the proposed institutional reforms, as well as an
 improved culture. Men will also directly benefit from the research to inform
 targeted training and response frameworks, and external expertise on training
 on the issue of gender-based violence.</span></p>

 <p><span>These
 measures will reinforce the systemic efforts to change the culture and working
 conditions in the Canadian Armed Forces in relation to sexual misconduct and
 gender-based violence with the ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating sexual
 misconduct and gender-based violence among members of the Canadian Armed Forces,
 particularly women members. Ultimately, this will support the objective of
 increasing representation of women in the Forces from 15 to 25 per cent by 2026
 which, if achieved, will further positively reinforce culture change.</span></p>

                <summary><h3>Responding to the Tragedy of Missing and
 Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls</h3></summary>

 <p>Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be
 murdered or missing than any other women in Canada. In 2019, the rate of
 homicide for Indigenous women was seven times that of non-Indigenous women.</p>

 <p>While comprising roughly five per cent of the population
 of Canada, Indigenous people accounted for nearly 26 per cent of homicide
 victims in 2019 and represent over 30&nbsp;per cent of the incarcerated
 population. The overrepresentation is even more pronounced for Indigenous women
 and youth, who account for 42&nbsp;per cent and 43 per cent of the women and
 youth inmate population in Canada.</p>

 <p>This investment will primarily benefit First Nation, Inuit
 and Métis women, girls and two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
 queer, questioning, intersex and asexual (2SLGBTQQIA+) people, as well as
 survivors of violence and families of victims of violence.</p>

 <p>This investment will also contribute to improved,
 culturally responsive policing and community safety services, and will benefit
 all Indigenous community members, including women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+
 people, who are disproportionately affected by violence, and are
 overrepresented in the justice and correctional systems.</p>

 <p>Lastly, it will support Indigenous-led justice and culture
 initiatives, and help ensure the languages, voices, and perspectives of
 Indigenous women and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people are heard.</p>

 Foundation and Helping Communities Respond to an Increase in Racism: Race
 Relations Foundation</h3></summary>

 <p>While funding will benefit all Canadians by reducing
 discrimination and violence, members of Canada’s racialized communities—Asian,
 Black and Indigenous Canadians, cultural and religious minorities, and
 newcomers to Canada—are expected to benefit most directly. In 2016, 25 per cent
 of discrimination complaints received by the Canadian Human Rights Commission
 related to race, religion, colour, national or ethnic origin. In Canada in
 2017, 43 per cent of hate crimes were motivated by hatred of a race or ethnicity.
 In Canada, women, especially racialized women, face a 20 per cent higher
 victimization rate than men. </p>

 <p>Recent reports indicate rising rates of COVID-driven,
 anti-Asian racism. A project led by the Chinese Canadian National Council found
 that between March 10, 2020, to February 28, 2021, there were 1,150 cases of
 racist attacks from across Canada reported, with children and adolescents under
 18 years of age more likely to report being physically assaulted. Those in
 low-income jobs or those who do not speak English are also more likely to
 report feeling vulnerable to racist attacks. </p>

                <summary><h3>Enhancing the Canada Workers Benefit</h3></summary>

 <p><span>Enhancing the Canada Workers Benefit
 (CWB) will benefit 3 million low- and modest-income workers, including about 1
 million new recipients through direct income support and by promoting
 longer-term attachment to the labour force. Women account for just over half of
 those benefiting from the enhancement and half of new recipients. </span></p>

 <p><span>The enhancements will especially benefit
 single workers without children, 52 per cent of whom will be men. These workers
 often have few other supports available to them, and 54 per cent of new funding
 will benefit this group. </span></p>

 <p><span>Groups that are more likely to be in
 receipt of the CWB include recent immigrants, those aged 19-34, and those
 without a post-secondary qualification. </span></p>

 <p><span>By lifting almost 100,000 individuals out
 of poverty, an enhanced CWB will also have a direct, positive impact on
 economic security. Reducing poverty contributes to improved food security,
 better physical and mental health, and supports dignity and resilience. </span></p>

 <p><b><i><span>GBA+ Responsive
 Approach</span></i></b></p>

 <p><span>Raising the
 income threshold where the CWB is reduced will help reward full-time work for
 single workers and primary earners. However, the family-based design of the CWB
 means that when a secondary earner enters the workforce, this may cause a
 decline in their family’s entitlement, especially if their partner’s income is
 already at or above that threshold.</span></p>

 <p><span>The secondary
 earner exemption will allow secondary earners benefitting from the CWB, </span><span>about 75 per cent of whom will be women, </span><span>to
 exclude a portion of their earnings from the benefit’s income test, mitigating
 or preventing this decline. This new feature will help ensure that everyone is
 able to participate in the workforce.</span></p>

                <summary><h3>Expanding Access to Drug Treatment Courts</h3></summary>

 <p><span>Drug Treatment Courts are targeted to non‑violent
 offenders and are focused on facilitating treatment as an alternative to
 incarceration for drug offences. The vast majority of participants in Drug
 Treatment Courts are vulnerable and marginalized with multiple issues, such as
 problematic substance use, mental health concerns, inadequate housing, reliance
 on income assistance, and low employment or education opportunities.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to the Association of Drug
 Treatment Court Professionals, as many as 90 per cent of participants have a
 history of prior convictions, and up to 70 per cent suffer from depression or
 anxiety disorders. In some Drug Treatment Courts, as many as 95 per cent of
 participants are unemployed upon entering the program, with 22 per cent
 reporting criminal activity as their sole source of income. Drug Treatment
 Courts offer supports to participants to help reduce substance use, increase
 employment and education opportunities, and decrease likelihood of re-offending.</span></p>

 <p><span>Between 2009 and 2014, 68 per cent of
 Drug Treatment Courts participants were men, and close to a third were between
 30 to 40 years of age. Indigenous peoples, who are at greater risk of
 experiencing mental health and substance use issues, represented 28 per cent of
 participants, despite only representing five per cent of the population. Some
 Drug Treatment Courts offer specialized programming to address the unique needs
 of participants, including Indigenous peoples and women.</span></p>

 <p><span>Government investments in homelessness
 will directly benefit Canadians experiencing or at risk of homelessness.
 Economic downturns, such as the one caused by COVID‑19, increase the risk
 of homelessness.</span></p>

 <p><span>Homelessness affects a diverse
 population, though certain groups are overrepresented. In 2017:</span></p>

 <p><span>·<span>
 </span></span>Indigenous people represented 24 per cent of shelter users
 despite accounting for five per cent of the population. </p>

 <p><span>·<span>
 </span></span>Men represented 72 per cent of shelter users. (Women may be
 underestimated due to lack of data from domestic violence shelters, and
 differences in terms of how women experience homelessness). </p>

 <p><span>·<span>
 </span></span>People aged 25 to 49 made up 53 per cent of shelter users, well
 above their population share (33 per cent).</p>

 <p>Veterans are more likely than
 average to experience chronic homelessness. </p>

 <p>As many as 85 per cent of people experiencing homelessness
 report a chronic health condition. By helping vulnerable people find housing,
 this measure will improve physical and mental health outcomes. </p>

 <p><span>Canada’s population is increasingly diverse.
 In 2016, people identifying as a member of a visible minority group accounted
 for 22.4 per cent of the population, compared to 13.4 per cent in 2001. The proposed
 research initiative would build evidence to inform policies that lead to positive
 outcomes for diverse populations of women, seniors, Indigenous populations,
 racialized people, and LGBTQ2 people. Beneficiaries would also include researchers
 who receive research grants. Recent analysis of Social Sciences and Humanities
 Research Council programs found that slightly more than 50 per cent of funded
 applicants identified as women. There is also academic evidence that suggests
 research on issues of societal inequalities is more often undertaken by
 researchers from marginalized groups. For example, research applications from Black
 scientists are significantly more likely to involve human subjects than White
 applicants (49.8 per cent versus 31.8 per cent) and to include fields of study
 that are relevant to equality research, such as population and behavioural
 sciences. </span></p>

 <p><span>Although mental health issues can affect
 any Canadian, certain groups are more vulnerable to experiencing mental illness
 in their lifetime. Youth, LGBTQ2 and Indigenous people are particularly
 vulnerable. Men are at a higher risk of dying by suicide. Men are also more
 likely to suffer from substance misuse. Women are more likely to be diagnosed
 with mood and anxiety disorders. </span></p>

 <p><span>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the
 many challenges and inequalities faced by these groups by increasing isolation
 and limiting Canadians’ ability to access traditional mental health services
 (e.g., in-person counselling). </span></p>

 Veterans</h3></summary>

 <p><span>Veterans are three to four times as
 likely to suffer from depressive or anxiety disorders, and more than 15 times
 more likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), than Canadians of
 comparable age and sex. Female veterans are more likely than male veterans to
 experience depression (35 per cent vs. 24 per cent) and anxiety (25 per cent
 vs. 21 per cent), but slightly less likely than males to report having PTSD (22
 per cent vs. 24 per cent). In Canada, the estimated veteran population is
 629,300, of which about 119,000 are clients of Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC). Approximately
 12 per cent of VAC clients are women. Since members of the Canadian Armed
 Forces are predominantly men, more men are expected to benefit from this

 <p><span>This initiative targets veterans and
 their immediate families. Since members of the Canadian Armed Forces are predominantly
 men, more men are expected to benefit from this initiative. However, this
 measure supports projects tailored to improve the well-being of all veterans
 and their families, including veterans who are women, LGBTQ2, Indigenous, or experience
 homelessness. There are currently around 3,000 homeless veterans in Canada. Veterans
 are more likely than the Canadian general population to experience activity
 limitations and suffer from a range of health issues. Many veterans also face
 challenges transitioning from military to civilian life. Employment rates
 amongst veterans is lower than for Canadians of similar age and sex (60 per
 cent vs 73 per cent). Amongst veterans, women and recently released veterans
 are less likely to be employed.</span></p>

 <p><span>This program directly benefits persons
 with disabilities by making Canadian communities and workplaces more accessible.</span></p>

 <p>For example, almost 2.7 million people or 1 in 10 Canadians
 aged 15 and older have a mobility disability, making it one of the
 most common disability types. Women (11.2 per cent) are more likely than men
 (7.9 per cent) to have a disability related to mobility. In 2017, over
 half (57.4 per cent) of employed Canadians with mobility disabilities aged 25 to 64 said
 that they required one or more workplace accommodations to be able to work.</p>

 <p><span>By increasing accessibility in workplaces
 or communities, including community spaces such as parks and public buildings,
 the program also benefits seniors without disabilities and families with young
 children.</span></p>

 <p><span>By improving
 seniors’ access to practical supports, the initiative will also indirectly
 benefit seniors’ unpaid caregivers, of which 54 per cent are women and many are

 Separation Monies do not Delay Employment Insurance Benefits</h3></summary>

 <p><span>There is currently limited data and
 information to provide a full picture of workers affected by this policy
 simplification. However, available statistics indicate that women who received Employment
 Insurance (EI) regular benefits in 2018 were slightly more likely (23.7&nbsp;per
 cent) than men (17.4&nbsp;per cent) to receive severance or vacation pay. </span></p>

 <p><span>Generally, severance pay is reserved for
 employees who do not have an end-date in their employment contract and
 increases with employment tenure. As a result, workers laid off from jobs that
 are long-tenured and permanent, and therefore likely higher-paying, are
 expected to benefit most from this measure. However, part-time workers who receive
 vacation pay on separation would also benefit. </span></p>

 Benefits to Better Support Canadians Suffering From Illness or Injury</h3></summary>

 <p><span>It is expected that women and older
 workers would benefit more from an extension of Employment Insurance (EI)
 sickness benefits. In 2018-19, the majority of sickness claims were made by
 women (56 per cent). Additionally, women were slightly more likely to exhaust
 their sickness benefits (36&nbsp;per cent vs. 33 per cent from men). Take-up of
 sickness claims, their duration, and exhaustion rates increase with age.
 Claimants aged 55 years and older register the longest average duration of EI
 sickness claims (10.2 weeks in 2018-19) and exhaustion rate (39 per cent in
 2018-19). </span></p>

 <p><span>This measure will benefit northerners and
 Indigenous peoples living in isolated and semi-isolated communities. Food
 prices in the North can be significantly higher than those in the south. For
 example, across 11 key essential items, in 2018, Nunavummiut generally paid
 around 2.2 times more for the same items than the rest of Canada. In 2017/2018,
 compared to the national average of 13 per cent, household food insecurity in
 Yukon and Northwest Territories was 17 per cent and 22 per cent respectively.
 Food insecurity was highest in Nunavut (whose poverty rate is more than double
 the national average), with 57 per cent of households living with food insecurity
 and 78 per cent of Nunavummiut children living in food-insecure households. </span></p>

 <p>Measures are designed to improve health outcomes for First
 Nations and Inuit who face a lower life expectancy and a higher disease burden than
 non‑Indigenous people in Canada, including higher rates of chronic and
 infectious diseases. These measures will improve access to health care services
 and will directly benefit individuals in remote and isolated communities,
 especially individuals living on reserve. Investments will also support the
 transformation of the health system, and ensure that Indigenous perspectives
 and knowledge inform the development and delivery of health supports for
 Indigenous people. Women, who make up the majority of nurses in First Nations
 communities, will also indirectly benefit from these investments.</p>

 <p><span>Indigenous children are significantly
 overrepresented in the child welfare system. In 2016, Indigenous children represented
 7.7&nbsp;per cent of all children ages 1-14, but they represented 52.2 per cent
 of children in foster care.</span></p>

 <p><span>These measures are gender balanced and
 will benefit Indigenous children from low income families and single parent
 households, who are more likely than other children to enter the child welfare
 system. These investments will support the implementation of the <i>Act
 respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families </i>and
 will also support First Nations to adopt preventative measures, under the First
 Nations Child and Family Services Program.<i> </i></span></p>

 <p><span>Funding will benefit all Canadians by
 providing more opportunities to participate in community-level sport
 programming. In addition, funding will be used to reach populations that have
 the lowest rates of participation in organized sport, including women and
 girls, LGBTQ2, low-income Canadians, Indigenous peoples, and racialized people.
 Additionally, participation rates tend to decline as people age, so adults and
 older Canadians may indirectly benefit. Women and girls in particular quit
 sport earlier and more often, are subject to abuse and discrimination in sport,
 and have fewer opportunities to participate. For example, one in three girls
 will drop out of sport during adolescence, whereas only one in ten boys will
 drop out of sport during the same phase of life. Low-income Canadians will also
 benefit from this proposal, as household income heavily influences
 participation rates. </span></p>

 Nations, women represent about 40 per cent of the Venezuelan migrant and

 and children, face gender-based violence, forced prostitution, and difficulty
 in accessing sexual and reproductive health services. This is why Canada’s
 response to the Venezuelan crisis will identify specific actions to reduce
 barriers and will contribute, through its programming in the different sectors,
 to the production of sex-disaggregated data. The data will contribute to
 identifying the gaps related to the impact of this crisis on girls, boys,
 women, and men. Finally, as a majority of Venezuelan migrants and refugees have
 seen their source of income disrupted, intervention in economic integration and
 access to services will mostly benefit low-income individuals in the region.</span></p>

 <p><span>Canadian efforts are expected to alleviate
 some of the adverse impacts of conflicts and displacements in the Middle East,
 which have severely affected the population, particularly women and girls.</span></p>

 <p><span>The strategy will seek to address barriers
 to gender equality by integrating the needs and rights of women and girls through
 the promotion of increased participation in governance and conflict resolution.
 The strategy will continue to build on the achievements to date. Previous
 funding has helped improve the quality of education for over 1.9&nbsp;million
 children, including Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.</span></p>

 <p><span>The military capacity-building efforts
 will also support the meaningful participation of women in peace and security
 efforts, by promoting the recruitment and integration of women in local security
 forces, and funding the construction of separate accommodations for women. </span></p>

 COVID-19 Response</h3></summary>

 <p><span>By committing to delivering
 COVID-19-related international assistance under Canada’s Feminist International
 Assistance Policy, Canada is supporting efforts that have the highest potential
 to reach groups that face vulnerability and marginalization. To date, among its
 international assistance efforts, Canada has been a key contributor to the
 Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), which facilitates the procurement
 and delivery of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics to developing countries.
 This benefits women and other vulnerable groups, as ACT-A’s goal of 20 per cent
 global vaccination coverage by the end of 2021 prioritizes health care workers
 (comprising 70 per cent women, worldwide) and vulnerable groups such as those
 with pre-existing conditions. Canada’s additional contributions to respond to
 international COVID-19 needs will further strengthen these efforts.</span></p>

		 of the Canadian bio-economy workforce. This underrepresentation is most

		 <p><span>The removal of internal trade barriers has

		 Only 15.7 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses in the broader economy

		 <p><span>More generally, SIF projects may result in
		 a higher proportion of direct benefits accruing to workers in highly innovative

		 While the SIF is sector agnostic, this could include sectors like
		 bio-manufacturing and life sciences, or aerospace and automotive manufacturing.
		 This could result in slightly greater benefits for men and higher income
		 individuals given the demographics of these sectors. Depending on the projects
		 ultimately selected it is possible that certain regions in Canada could see
		 greater benefits from SIF projects than others.</span></p>

		 <p><span>High-speed internet will provide benefits
		 to Canadians living in rural and remote communities, where costs of services
		 are often higher. Only 41 per cent of households in rural areas have access to
		 internet speeds of 50/10 megabits per second compared to nearly 100 per cent of
		 households in large urban areas. Faster broadband projects support diversity by
		 enabling people to fully participate in online spaces, for people of different
		 background to share resources, and build connections. High-speed internet can
		 create new economic opportunities that benefit rural households and improve
		 accesses to services, such as remote health and distance learning. Average
		 weekly earnings of residents in large urban areas is estimated to be
		 15-25&nbsp;per cent higher than average weekly earnings of residents in rural areas.</span></p>

		 <p>Similarly, Indigenous communities located in remote areas
		 can expect to benefit from faster speeds and improved access to online services

		 <p><span>COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on non-national

		 expected to indirectly benefit. This sector is comprised predominantly of men
		 (70 per cent). All Canadians would benefit from the digitization of information
		 and collections and the creation of original content such as educational
		 materials or virtual activities. Data show that youth and those aged 25-49 are

		 Diabetes</h3></summary>

		 <p>Approximately 3.2 million Canadians are living with
		 diabetes and 200,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. People living with
		 pre-existing chronic health conditions, such as obesity, are at increased risk
		 for developing type 2 diabetes, which make up 90 per cent of cases. The rate of
		 diabetes is approximately 16 per cent higher among men and more than twice as
		 high among South Asian and Black adults as compared to Caucasian adults.
		 Further, First Nations adults living on reserve and in northern communities
		 have a significantly higher rate of diabetes. Supporting further research into
		 the causes, treatment, and development of a potential cure for diabetes is also
		 expected to benefit children with juvenile diabetes. Although diabetes is
		 generally more common in men, inequalities in the rates of diabetes by income,
		 education level, and employment are greater among women. For example, women
		 with no high school diploma are 2.2 times more likely to be obese than female
		 university graduates. </p>

		 <p><span>There is

		 is estimated that the average daily smoker spent about $3,150 on cigarettes in
		 2020. The measure would increase the amount of excise duty embedded in the

		 <p>Measures to support Improving and Defending our Cyber
		 Networks, Modernizing Critical IT Infrastructure by Shared Services Canada,
		 Supporting Efficient, Stable Digital Applications, and the Office of the Chief
		 Information Officer of the Government of Canada are expected to benefit all
		 Canadians through more secure and reliable digital government services and
		 internal operations. Persons with disabilities, over the age of 60, or living
		 in rural or remote areas may benefit most from investments in networking and
		 digital applications if they have difficulty accessing government services in
		 person. Indirectly, men may benefit disproportionately as new IT staff and
		 procurements come from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
		 field, which has predominantly male workers.</p>

                <summary><h3>Financial Sector Legislative Measures</h3></summary>

		 <p>The measures seek to improve the governance and
		 functioning of Canada’s financial sector and institutions, changes which are
		 expected to benefit all Canadians through a strong economy and strong public
		 institutions such as strengthening the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation,
		 enhancing consumer protection, and ensuring the integrity of Canada’s financial
		 system through strong anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
		 policies. Combatting money laundering and terrorist financing will benefit
		 people who are victimized by these and other related crimes, particularly
		 vulnerable groups, such as women and children, who are more likely to be
		 victimized. </p>
