    <p>For periods 11 to 16, the top-up rate is based on the same revenue drop used to calculate your base rate.</p>
    <h3 id="qualify">Examples of how much you may qualify for</h3>
    <details>
      <summary>Your revenue drop is 60% in any period from 11 to 16</summary>
      <p>In this example, you are calculating the period 11 wage subsidy for your employees Maude and Jean-Pierre, who have been working throughout the claim period (active employees) and are not related to you (arm’s-length employees).</p>
      <h4>Step 1: Determine your revenue drop</h4>
      <p>For this example, you’ve been using the general method to calculate your drop in eligible revenue since period 5 and have already figured out all the revenue drops you’ll need for period 11:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Claim period month: December 2020 divided by December 2019: 60% drop</li>
        <li>Previous period month: November 2020 divided by November 2019: 58% drop</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Step 2: Calculate the subsidy rate</h4>
      <p>To calculate your base and top-up rates, use the higher of the two revenue drops from step 1: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the claim period month revenue drop (December)<br>
          or</li>
        <li>the previous month's revenue drop (November)</li>
        <li>In this example, you’ll use the December revenue drop of 60% because it is higher than the previous period month’s revenue drop of 58%.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="lst-none">
        <li>Revenue drop of 60% = maximum <strong>base rate of 40%</strong></li>
        <li>Revenue drop of 60% = 1.75 x (60%-50%) = <strong>top-up rate of 17.5%</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Step 3: Add the base rate and top-up rate to get your overall subsidy rate</h4>
      <p><strong>Base rate of 40% + top-up rate of 17,5% = overall rate of 57.5%</strong></p>
      <h4>Step 4: Calculate the amount of subsidy for your employee</h4>
      <p>Let’s say Maude made $1500/week during the claim period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>57.5% (your overall subsidy rate) of $1,129/week (the maximum amount of remuneration per week)</li>
        <li>$1,129 x 57.5% = <strong>$649.18/week</strong></li>
        <li>$649.18 x 4 weeks = $2596.70 for Maude for this claim period</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let’s say Jean-Pierre made $500/week during the claim period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>57.5% (your overall subsidy rate) of $500/week (Jean-Pierre’s eligible weekly remuneration)</li>
        <li>$500 x 57.5% = <strong>$287.50/week</strong></li>
        <li>$287.50 x 4 weeks = $1150 for Jean-Pierre for this claim period</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Your revenue drop is 60% in period 8, 9, or 10</summary>
      <p>In this example, you are calculating the period 8 wage subsidy for your employees Bess and Jer, who have been working throughout the claim period (active employees) and are not related to you (arm’s-length employees).</p>
      <h4>Step 1: Determine your revenue drop</h4>
      <p>For this example, you’ve been using the general method to calculate your drop in eligible revenue since period 5 and have already figured out all the revenue drops you’ll need for period 8:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Claim period month: October 2020 divided by October 2019: 60% drop</li>
        <li>Previous period month: September 2020 divided by September 2019: 58% drop</li>
        <li>Average of July, August, and September, 2020, divided by the average of July, August, and September, 2019: 66% drop</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Step 2: Calculate the subsidy rate</h4>
      <p>For the base rate, use the higher of the two revenue drops from step 1:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the claim period month revenue drop (October)<br>
          or</li>
        <li>the previous month's revenue drop (September)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="lst-none">
        <li>In this example, you’ll use the October revenue drop of 60% because it is higher than the previous period month’s revenue drop of 58%.</li>
        <li>Revenue drop of 60% = maximum <strong>base rate of 40%</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the top-up rate, use the higher of these two amounts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the revenue drop you used when calculating your base rate (the higher of either the claim period month or the previous period month)<br>
          and </li>
        <li>the average revenue drop over the three months prior to the claim period compared to the average monthly revenue of the same 3 months in the previous year</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this example, you’ll use the three-month average drop (July, August, and September) of 66% because it is higher than the base revenue drop of 60%.</p>
      <p>Top-up revenue drop of 66% = 1.25 x (66%-50%) = <strong>top-up rate of 20%</strong></p>
      <h4>Step 3: Add the base rate and top-up rate to get your overall subsidy rate</h4>
      <p><strong>Base rate of 40% + top-up rate of 20% = overall rate of 60%</strong></p>
      <h4>Step 4: Calculate the amount of subsidy for your employee</h4>
      <p>Let’s say Bess made $1500/week during the claim period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>60% (your overall subsidy rate) of $1,129/week (the maximum amount of remuneration per week)</li>
        <li>$1,129 x 60% = <strong>$677.40/week</strong></li>
        <li>$677.40 x 4 weeks = $2709.60 for Bess for this claim period</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let’s say Jer made $500/week during the claim period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>60% (your overall subsidy rate) of $500/week (Jer’s eligible weekly remuneration)</li>
        <li>$500 x 60% = <strong>$300/week</strong></li>
        <li>$300 x 4 weeks = $1200 for Jer for this claim period</li>

      <summary>Your revenue drop is 30% in period 8, 9, or 10</summary>
      <p>In this example, you are calculating the period 10 wage subsidy for your employees Sam and Lindy, who have been working throughout the claim period (active employees) and are not related to you (arm’s-length employees).</p>
      <h4>Step 1: Determine your revenue drop </h4>
      <p>For this example, you’ve been using the alternative method to calculate your drop in eligible revenue since period 5 and have already figured out all the revenue drops you’ll need to compare for this period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Claim period month: average of January and February, 2020, compared to December 2020: 22% drop </li>
        <li>Previous month: average of January and February, 2020, compared to November 2020: 30% drop</li>
        <li>Average of January and February, 2020, compared to the average of September, October, and November, 2020: 26% drop </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Step 2: Calculate the subsidy rate </h4>
      <p>For the base rate, you’ll use the November revenue drop of 30% because it is higher than the claim period month’s revenue drop of 22%. </p>
      <ul class="lst-none">
        <li>Revenue drop of 30% = base rate calculation 30% x 0.8 = base rate of 24% </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because neither the drop you used to calculate your base rate (30%) nor your three-month average drop (26%) were over 50%, your top-up rate will be 0.</p>
      <ul class="lst-none">
        <li>Top-up revenue drop less than 50.00% = no top-up amount</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Step 3: Add the base rate and top-up rate to get your overall subsidy rate</h4>
      <p>Base rate of 24% + top-up rate of 0% = overall rate of 24% </p>
      <h4>Step 4: Calculate the amount of subsidy for your employee </h4>
      <p>Let’s say Sam made $1500/week during the claim period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>24% (your overall subsidy rate) of $1,129/week (the maximum amount of remuneration per week)</li>
        <li>$1,129 x 24% = <strong>$270.96/week</strong></li>
        <li>$270.96/week x 4 weeks = $1083.84 for Sam for this claim period</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let’s say Lindy made $500/week during the claim period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>24% (your overall subsidy rate) of $500/week (Lindy’s eligible weekly remuneration)</li>
        <li>$500 x 24% = <strong>$120/week</strong></li>
        <li>$120 x 4 weeks = $480 for Lindy for this claim period</li>
      </ul>
