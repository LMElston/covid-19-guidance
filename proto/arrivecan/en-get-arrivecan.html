			<h2 id="keeping-safe">Keeping Canadians safe </h2>
			<p>As part of Canada's efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and prevent importation, all
				travellers are required to provide contact and quarantine information upon and after entry into
				Canada. This information is crucial to Canada's response to COVID-19.</p>
			<p><mark>Paper forms can be incomplete or inaccurate - and can take days to process. To help provinces and territories protect their citizens, the Government of Canada is moving to a safer and faster paperless process. </mark></p>


			<h2 id="requirements">Requirements for entry and after entry to Canada</h2>
			<h3 id="requirements-air">Requirements for entering Canada by air</h3>
			<p>As of November 21, 2020, if you're flying to Canada as your final destination, <strong>you must use ArriveCAN </strong>to
				submit your:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>travel and contact information</li>
				<li>quarantine plan (unless exempted under conditions set out in the <a
						href="https://orders-in-council.canada.ca/attachment.php?attach=39829&amp;lang=en">mandatory
						isolation order</a>)</li>
				<li>COVID-19 symptom self-assessment</li>
			</ul>
			<p><mark>You must use ArriveCAN <strong> before you board your flight</strong> to Canada: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>once you submit your information through ArriveCAN, a receipt will be displayed </li>
						<li>have that receipt ready to show to a Canadian border services officer </li>
						<li>you can show your receipt from the app, as a screenshot, or printed</li>
					</mark></ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>If you don't </strong>submit your information through ArriveCAN, you may:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>face additional delays at the border for public health questioning</li>
				<li>be subject to enforcement action, which can range from verbal warnings to $1,000 fines</li>
			</ul>
			<details>
				<summary>Exceptions to mandatory digital submission:</summary>
				<ol>
					<li>travellers who are in transit to another country and are not leaving the secure area at the airport,  should not submit	their information via ArriveCAN</li>
					<li><mark>if you unable to submit through ArriveCAN for a reason such as a disability, inadequate
						infrastructure, a service disruption or a natural
						disaster, the travel information may be
						provided in a form and manner and at a time specified
						by the Minister of Health</mark></li>
				</ol>
			</details>


			<h3 id="requirements-land-sea">Entering Canada by land or sea</h3>
			<p>If you're travelling to Canada by land or sea, you're strongly encouraged to submit your travel
				information through ArriveCAN. This will speed up processing at the border and limit points of contact.
			</p>
			<p>Show your ArriveCAN receipt to the border services officer.</p>

			<h3 id="requirements-after">Requirements after you've entered Canada</h3>
			<p>As of November 21, 2020, all travellers, whether they travel by air, land or sea, must
				report daily after their entry into Canada. If you are entering Canada for <a href="#exempt">exempt travel</a>, you don't have to report after you’ve entered Canada.</p>
			<p class="mrgn-tp-md">You <strong>must</strong> report:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>to confirm that you've arrived at the address you provided for your quarantine or isolation location
					within 48 hours of your entry into Canada</li>
				<li>to complete daily COVID-19 symptom self-assessment during your quarantine period</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you don't complete your reporting after you’ve entered Canada:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you may receive phone calls or public health follow-ups.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>How to report depends on if you:</strong></p>
			<details>
				<summary>Used ArriveCAN to enter Canada</summary>

				<p>
					If you’ve used ArriveCAN before you entered Canada, continue to use it daily after your arrival.
					You'll be able to complete your mandatory reporting in less than a minute.
				</p>

			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Didn't use ArriveCAN to enter Canada</summary>

				<p>
					If you submitted your information on a paper form, or verbally, when you entered Canada, you cannot
					use ArriveCAN to complete your mandatory reporting. You must call 1-833-641-0343 instead. It will
					take approximately 5 minutes to complete your daily reports.
				</p>

			</details>



			<h2 id="how-to-use-arriveCAN">How to use ArriveCAN</h2>
			<p>Use ArriveCAN to submit your information easily and securely before your arrival
				in Canada. ArriveCAN is available to <a href="#download">download as a mobile app</a> or you can <a
					href="https://arrivecan.cbsa-asfc.cloud-nuage.canada.ca/privacy">sign in online.</a></p>
			<p>Whether you're entering Canada by air, land or sea, use ArriveCAN to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>provide required contact information for you and your family travelling together</li>
				<li>answer questions about your quarantine plan if your trip is not exempt from quarantine
					requirements</li>
				<li>get an ArriveCAN confirmation receipt to show to border services officers, or take a screenshot or
					print your confirmation if you sign in online</li>
				<li>report after your entry and complete COVID-19 symptom self-assessments</li>
			</ul>
			<details>
				<summary>
					<h3>Details you will provide to ArriveCAN</h3>
				</summary>
				<p>You provide the following information in ArriveCAN:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>contact information, such as your name, date of birth, email address, phone number and
						travel document details</li>
					<li>travel details, such as your:
						<ul>
							<li>date of arrival</li>
							<li>port of entry if you’re entering by land or marine vessel <strong>or</strong></li>
							<li>flight number, airport and airline if you're entering by air</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>the purpose of your travel (such as exempt travel, work, study, family reunification or <a

							grounds</a>)</li>
					<li>any symptoms you may be experiencing</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For your quarantine plan, questions will include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>whether you have a place to quarantine or isolate for 14 days</li>
					<li>the address of the place where you'll be staying during your quarantine or isolation
						period</li>
					<li>if there are vulnerable people at that place</li>
					<li>if it's a group living environment or houses multiple families</li>
					<li>if you can have food, medication and other necessities delivered to you while in
						quarantine</li>
				</ul>
				<p><mark>Meeting the conditions of a suitable quarantine plan</p>
				<p> If you arrive in Canada without a suitable quarantine plan, you will be asked to develop a quarantine plan within your financial means. Those that are not able to confirm a suitable quarantine plan, may be required to quarantine/isolate at a Designated Quarantine Facility.</mark></p>

				<p>The ArriveCAN mobile app saves your contact information (name, date of birth and travel document
					information) for travel at a later date.</p>
				<p>If you're an <a

				<summary>
					<h3>Submitting information for others</h3>
				</summary>
				<p><strong>If you're travelling with others,</strong> you can include multiple travellers in your ArriveCAN
					submission.</p>
				<p>As the primary traveller, you may provide travel information for yourself and for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>your spouse or common law partner</li>
					<li>your children (or children for whom you have legal guardianship), aged 18 years or
						younger</li>
					<li>any other adult for whom you're a legal guardian</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can provide information for up to 8 travellers, including yourself, in a single
					submission. Use this when:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>you'll all stay together at the same address for the entire quarantine/isolation period
						<strong>and</strong></li>
					<li>you have their permission to collect and share this information</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>If you're not the traveller,</strong>you can submit travel information on behalf of others who may be unable to use ArriveCAN.  <a
						href="https://arrivecan.cbsa-asfc.cloud-nuage.canada.ca/">Sign in online.</a>  Once you've submitted their information, print the
