			<p>It may not be appropriate to use a percentage of these costs. For example, if the expenses you paid (such as cleaning materials or paint) were to maintain a part of the house that was not used as a work space, then you cannot deduct any part of them. Alternatively, if the expenses you paid were to maintain the work space only, then you may be able to deduct all or most of them.</p>

			<p>In order to deduct interest on a mortgage or hypothec relating to a work space in the home, the interest must also meet the requirements for deduction under <span class="nowrap">paragraph 20(1)(c)</span>. Information concerning the application of <span class="nowrap">paragraph 20(1)(c)</span> can be found in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-3-property-investments-savings-plans/series-3-property-investments-savings-plan-folio-6-interest/income-tax-folio-s3-f6-c1-interest-deductibility.html">Income Tax <span class="nowrap">Folio S3-F6-C1,</span> Interest Deductibility</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, interest expense is considered a capital expenditure that is precluded from deduction by <span class="nowrap">paragraph 18(1)(b)</span>. However, interest is deductible if the requirements of <span class="nowrap">paragraph 20(1)(c)</span> are met and the deduction is not otherwise precluded by another provision of the Act.</p>
<p>Among the requirements in <span class="nowrap">paragraph 20(1)(c)</span> is the requirement that an amount be paid in the year or payable in respect of the year, pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on borrowed money used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property. The relevant use is the <strong>current use</strong> and not the original use of borrowed money. In determining the current use of borrowed money, a taxpayer must establish a link between the money that was borrowed and its current use.</p>
<p>Interest arising on borrowed money used to purchase a principal residence will not generally qualify for deduction Under <span class="nowrap">paragraph 20(1)(c)</span> because the borrowed money will not be used for the purpose of earning income from a business or property. However, where a portion of an individual’s home is used as a work space (that is, an <span class="nowrap">income-earning</span> use), a portion of the interest arising on the borrowed money used to purchase that home may be deductible as a work space expense.&nbsp; To be deductible as a work space expense, such interest must otherwise be deductible under <span class="nowrap">paragraph 20(1)(c)</span> in computing income from that business. The portion of the annual interest expense arising on a mortgage or hypothec that may be deducted should be determined as described <span class="nowrap">in ¶2.18</span> <span class="nowrap">to 2.20.</span></p>
<p>An individual may borrow money under a line of credit that is secured by the individual's principal residence. Whether interest on that borrowed money is deductible under <span class="nowrap">paragraph 20(1)(c)</span> is a mixed question of fact and law. If borrowed funds on a line of credit secured by an individual’s principal residence are used to pay for personal items such as vacations or home improvements unrelated to the work space (such as a swimming pool installation), the portion of interest expense on the line of credit relating to those purchases will <strong>not</strong> be deductible for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>If borrowed funds on a line of credit secured by an individual’s principal residence are used to pay for outlays or expenses related to the work space (such as office equipment and furniture), the portion of interest on the line of credit relating to those purchases may be deductible as a work space expense. A deduction is subject to the apportionment requirement described <span class="nowrap">in ¶<a href="#p_2.18">2.18</a></span> <span class="nowrap">to 2.20</span> if the funds are used for something that benefits the home and the work space (such as the purchase of a new furnace or <span class="nowrap">air-conditioner</span>). The tracing/linking of borrowed money to an eligible use where a single borrowing account such as a line of credit is used for both eligible and ineligible purposes can be complex and the onus is on the taxpayer to trace/link borrowed funds to an eligible use.

				  <summary>In detail: Maintenance costs and minor repairs</summary>
				  <p>The cost of maintenance or minor repairs to an individual’s home may be deductible as a work space expense where the expense relates to the use of the work space. These expenses generally fall into one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintenance or minor repairs that relate to the work space <strong>only</strong> - for example, repainting the work space, or repairing walls or ceilings following the installation of phones, fax machines or other office equipment used in the work space. These expenses do not usually need to be apportioned for business and <span class="nowrap">non-business</span> use (as described <span class="nowrap">in ¶2.18</span> <span class="nowrap">to 2.20)</span> unless the work space is also used for personal purposes .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>maintenance or minor repairs that relate to the work space as well as other areas of the home - for example, regular maintenance or minor repairs to the home furnace or <span class="nowrap">air-conditioner</span> or the purchase of household cleaning supplies . Such expenses should generally be apportioned as described <span class="nowrap">in ¶2.18</span> <span class="nowrap">to 2.20.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>maintenance or minor repairs that do not relate to the work space - for example, repainting a bedroom. Such expenses are generally precluded from deduction by <span class="nowrap"><a href="#general">paragraphs 18(1)(a)</a></span> <span class="nowrap">or <a href="#p_2.34">18(1)(h)</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether maintenance or minor repairs can be deducted as a business use of home expense is a mixed question of fact and law to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.</p>

outlays on account of capital
<details class="mrgn-lft-sm"><summary>In detail: Outlays on account of capital</summary>
<p>Certain items typically acquired for use in a work space in the home may be considered to be on account of capital and precluded from deduction by <span class="nowrap">paragraph 18(1)(b)</span>. Examples of such items include computers, printers, filing cabinets, chairs, desks and lamps. Since these properties wear out or become obsolete over time, individuals can usually deduct the cost over a period of several years. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/report-business-income-expenses/claiming-capital-cost-allowance.html">Claiming capital cost allowance (CCA)</a>.</p></details></li>  <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span> expenses not related to an individual’s work space
<details class="mrgn-lft-sm"><summary>In detail: Expenses not related to a work space</summary>

     
 <p>The cost of telephone and internet service, consumed supplies (such as pens, pencils, paper clips, stationery, and stamps) and other similar expenses may relate to the business, but they do not relate to the work space. Expenses of this nature are not subject to the requirements in <span class="nowrap">subsection 18(12)</span> and may be deducted as a regular business expense.</p>  <p> <strong>2.33 </strong>To the extent that telephone and internet service at an individual’s home is used for both business and personal purposes, only the business portion of the expense will be deductible. A reasonable basis of proration should be used to determine the portion of any usage attributable to the individual’s business.</p>  
    



</details>
</li>  <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>  personal or living expenses
<details class="mrgn-lft-sm"><summary>In detail: Personal or living expenses </summary>

 <p>Expenses relating to an individual’s home that are <strong>personal or living expenses</strong> are specifically precluded from deduction by <span class="nowrap">paragraph 18(1)(h)</span>.</p>
 <p>The term <strong>personal or living expenses</strong> is defined in <span class="nowrap">subsection 248(1)</span> to include:</p>  <p>“… the expenses of properties maintained by any person for the use or benefit of the taxpayer or any person connected with the taxpayer by blood relationship, marriage or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partnership or adoption, and not maintained in connection with a business carried on for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit.”</p>  <p> <strong>2.36 </strong>Generally, an expense is incurred in connection with a business if there is a business purpose or need for the expenditure. In relation to this, the Supreme Court of Canada stated in <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/1frw1">Symes v Canada</a>, <span class="nowrap">[1993] 4</span> <span class="nowrap">SCR 695</span>, <span class="nowrap">94 DTC 6001</span>:</p>  <p>“… Would the need exist apart from the business? If a need exists even in the absence of a business activity, and irrespective of whether the need was or might have been satisfied by an expenditure to a third party or by the opportunity cost of personal labour, then an expense to meet the need would traditionally be viewed as a personal expense.”</p>
