                     <p>Your drop in revenue is calculated by comparing your eligible revenue during the reference period with your eligible revenue from a previous period (baseline revenue).</p>
                     <p>There is <strong>no minimum revenue drop</strong> required to qualify for the subsidy. The rate your revenue has dropped is only used to calculate how much subsidy you receive for these periods.</p>
