               <h3 id="calls">Calls and letters from the CRA </h3>
               <p>The CRA may need to contact you by phone or mail to confirm details, ask for more information about your application, or notify you that your claim was not approved. Please make sure your contact information is current. </p>
               <h4>Calls from the CRA</h4>
               <p>CRA phone agents will never:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>use threatening or coercive language</li>
                  <li>ask for full bank information, or </li>
                  <li>ask for your full Social Insurance Number (SIN) </li>
               </ul>
               <p>CRA phone agents should be able to provide you with information about your CERS application, as well as their name and phone number. </p>
               <p> If you have concerns about a call you received regarding your CERS application, please call the CRA's business enquiries line at 1-800-959-5525 and ask them to verify the name and number of the person that called you. You can also read more about <a href="/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud.html">how to recognize scams</a>.</p>
               <h4>Letters from the CRA</h4>
               <p> You may receive a letter from the CRA if your application for CERS was not accepted, or if your claim was modified after we review the information.</p>
               <h3 id="h-3">Consequences of fraudulent claims</h3>
               <p>If you do not meet the CERS eligibility requirements for a period, you will be required to repay any amounts you received for that period. Canadians can also report suspected CERS misuse through the CRA’s <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html">Leads program</a>.</p>
               <p>Penalties may apply in cases of fraudulent claims, including fines or even imprisonment.</p>
               <p>If you artificially reduce your revenue or increase your expenses for the purpose of claiming the rent subsidy, you will be required to repay any subsidy amounts you received, plus a penalty equal to 25% of the total value.</p>

               <h3 id="h-4">Keep your records</h3>
               <p>You must keep records showing information that supports your rent subsidy claim, such as your reduction in revenue and amounts for your eligible expenses.</p>
               <p>If you use the online calculator to calculate your subsidy amounts, print the results summary or save an electronic copy for your records. We may ask to see it when validating your claim.</p>
               <p>If you calculate your amounts another way, you must still save a record of how you came up with your amounts.</p>
               <p>If you have affiliated entities that are also applying for CERS for the same period you are, you must save a copy of the agreement you made about the percentage of the subsidy each business will claim.</p>
