                     <h2 class="h3">Experienced a drop in revenue</h2>
                     <p>Your drop in revenue is calculated by comparing your eligible revenue during the reference period with your eligible revenue from a previous period (baseline revenue). It is used to calculate how much subsidy you receive for the claim period.</p>
                     <p><strong>Period 1 to 10</strong></p>
                     <p>There is <strong>no minimum revenue drop</strong> required to qualify for the subsidy.</p>
                     <p><strong>Period 11 to 13</strong></p>
                     <p>Your revenue must have <strong>dropped more than 10%</strong> in order to qualify for the rent subsidy.</p>
                     <h3>Eligible revenue</h3>
                     <p>Eligible revenue generally includes revenue earned in Canada from: </p>
                     <ul>
                       <li>selling goods</li>
                       <li>rendering services, and</li>
                       <li>others' use of your resources</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Use your normal accounting method when calculating your eligible revenue.</p>
                     <p>If your normal accounting method is the accrual method, you can choose (elect) to use the cash method (and vice versa), but once you choose you must use the same accounting method for all your claims.</p>
                     <p>If you choose  to use the cash method, you need to check the “cash method” election box when completing your application.</p>
                     <p>The rules for calculating eligible revenue are the same for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS).</p>
