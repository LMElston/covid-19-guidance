      <h2 id="h-1">How the subsidy is calculated</h2>
      <p>The CERS provides both a base subsidy and, in some cases, a lockdown support amount.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>How much you may claim</summary>
        <p>The base subsidy rate applies to a maximum of $75,000 in eligible expenses per location and an overall maximum of $300,000 in expenses for you and any affiliated entities per claim period.</p>
        <p>If you must close or cease certain activities at one or more of your locations under a public health order for one week or longer, you may be eligible for lockdown support of up to 25% of eligible expenses per affected location for the days the order was in place.</p>

        <summary id="calculating-base-rate">Calculating your base rent subsidy rate</summary>
        <p>The amount you can claim of your expenses (your rent subsidy rate) is based on the <strong>revenue drop you experienced</strong> between the claim period you are applying for and a prior reference period.</p>
        <p>You have options for choosing which prior reference period you will use.</p>

        <summary>Calculating your lockdown support rate</summary>
        <p>In addition to the rent subsidy rate, you can receive a lockdown support amount for certain locations affected by public health restrictions.</p>
        <p>Your CERS lockdown support rate is 25% on lockdown, calculated as:</p>
        <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
          <li>25% fixed lockdown rate</li>
          <li class="brdr-bttm"><span class="fas fa-times fa-li"><span class="wb-inv">times</span></span> days the location was locked down due to the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
          <li class="brdr-bttm"><span class="fas fa-divide fa-li"><span class="wb-inv">divided by</span></span> 28 (the days in the CERS period)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>If you have a 0% rent subsidy rate, you cannot claim lockdown support for any location.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Example lockdown support rate calculation</summary>
          <p>For example, if one of your business locations was on lockdown for 7 days of the 28 day period, you would be eligible to receive:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>25% base lockdown rate multiplied by</li>
            <li>7 days out of 28</li>
            <li>for a 6.25% lockdown support rate.</li>

          <p>Lockdown support is calculated on a location-by-location basis.</p>
          <p>To qualify for lockdown support, you must have:</p>

            <li>a base rent subsidy rate of more than 0% for the claim period</li>
            <li>one or more locations temporarily closed, or have activities significantly restricted for a week or longer due to a COVID-19-related public health order

                  <summary>Example – Gloria’s Gift Shop</summary>
                  <p>Gloria owns a gift shop in Ontario.</p>
                  <p>Her location was closed due to a COVID-19 related public health order from May 4, 2021 to May 12, 2021 inclusive.</p>
                  <p>Claim period 8 ended on May 8, 2021.</p>
                  <p>This means her location was locked down for 9 days total, but:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>5 days occurred in claim period 8</li>
                    <li>4 days occurred in claim period 9</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <p>If Gloria used the CERS calculator to calculate the lockdown support when she applied for the rent subsidy for claim period 8 on May 9, 2021, she would not have received any lockdown support in her original claim.</p>
                  <p>However, if Gloria re-applies for the rent subsidy after <strong>May 20, 2021</strong>, she may receive a lockdown support payment in claim periods 8 and 9. She would be eligible based on the 5 days her business was closed at the end of the claim period 8 and the 4 days it was closed at the beginning of period 9. </p>
                  <p>The lockdown support for period 8 would be calculated for 5 days and for 4 days for period 9.</p>

          <p>A public health order must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>be issued by a federal, provincial, or municipal government, or a local health authority</li>
            <li>be limited based on at least one of these factors:
              <ul>
                <li>geographical boundaries</li>
                <li>type of business or other activity</li>

            <li>result in sanctions or be an offence if you do not comply</li>
            <li>require you or your non-arm’s-length tenant that has a business at the qualifying property to stop some or all of your regular business activities at the qualifying property while the order is in place
              <ul>
                <li>the activities that were stopped must account for at least approximately 25% of total revenues at that location during the prior reference period</li>
