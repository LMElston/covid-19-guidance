	      <p><strong>For periods 5 and 6 only</strong>, if you have an <a href="cews-how-revenue-drop-subsidy-rate-calculated.html#basedrop">eligible revenue drop</a> of at least 30% in the current or previous period, you are entitled to the higher CEWS rate between two calculations:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>the rate calculated using the rules for the current period (period 5 or 6), or </li>
                     <li>the rate calculated using the rules that were in place for period 4</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This means that in periods 5 and 6, if you had a revenue drop of 30% or more in the current or previous period, you would receive an overall CEWS rate of at least 75% and will not receive an amount less than what you would have under the old rules. </p>
                  <p>If you use the online calculator or spreadsheet to <a href="cews-calculate-subsidy-amount.html">calculate your subsidy amount</a>, the safe harbour rule is automatically applied if you qualify and it is to your benefit.</p>
				  <p>You <strong>cannot</strong> <a href="#rounding" aria-controls="rounding" class="wb-lbx" role="button">round your rate</a> to reach the 30% needed to qualify for the safe harbour rule.</p>
