    <h2>What It Means for Canadian Businesses</h2>
<p>To  help businesses keep and return workers to their payroll through the challenges  posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, proposed  the new Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. This would provide a 75 per cent wage  subsidy to eligible employers for up to 12 weeks, retroactive to March 15,  2020.  </p>
<p>  This wage subsidy aims to prevent  further job losses, encourage employers to re-hire workers previously laid off  as a result of COVID-19, and help better position Canadian companies and other employers  to more easily resume normal operations following the crisis. While the  Government has designed the proposed wage subsidy to provide generous and  timely financial support to employers, it was done with the expectation that  employers will do their part by using the subsidy in a manner that supports the  health and well-being of their employees.</p>
<h3>  Eligible  Employers </h3>
<p>  Eligible  employers would include individuals, taxable corporations, and partnerships  consisting of eligible employers as well as non‑profit organizations and  registered charities. </p>
<p>  Public  bodies would not be eligible for this subsidy. Public bodies include  municipalities and local governments, Crown corporations, public universities, colleges,  schools and hospitals. </p>
<p>  This  subsidy would be available to eligible employers that see a drop of at least 30  per cent of their revenue (see <em>Eligible  Periods</em>). In applying for the subsidy, employers would be required to  attest to the decline in revenue.</p>
<h3>Calculating  Revenues</h3>
<p>  An  employer’s revenue for this purpose would be its revenue from its business  carried on in Canada earned from arm’s-length sources. Revenue would be calculated  using the employer’s normal accounting method, and would exclude revenues from extraordinary  items and amounts on account of capital. </p>
<p>  For  non-profits and charities, the government will continue to work with the sector  to ensure the definition of revenue is appropriate to their specific  circumstances.</p>
<h3>  Amount  of Subsidy </h3>
<p>  The subsidy amount for a given employee on  eligible remuneration paid between March 15 and June 6, 2020 would be the  greater of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>75 per cent of the amount of  remuneration paid, up to a maximum benefit of $847 per week; and </li>
  <li>the amount of remuneration paid,  up to a maximum benefit of $847 per week or 75 per cent of the employee’s  pre-crisis weekly remuneration, whichever is less.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further guidance  with respect to how to define pre-crisis weekly remuneration for a given  employee will be provided in the coming days.  </p>
<p>  In  effect, employers may be eligible for a subsidy of up to 100 per cent of the  first 75 per cent of pre-crisis wages or salaries of existing employees.  These employers would be expected where  possible to maintain existing employees’ pre-crisis employment earnings.  </p>
<p>  Employers  will also be eligible for a subsidy of up to 75 per cent of salaries and wages  paid to new employees. </p>
<p>  Eligible  remuneration may include salary, wages, and other remuneration.  These are amounts for which employers would  generally be required to withhold or deduct amounts to remit to the Receiver  General on account of the employee’s income tax obligation.  However, it does not include severance pay, or  items such as stock option benefits or the personal use of a corporate vehicle. </p>
<p>  A special rule will apply to employees that do not deal at arm’s length  with the employer.  The subsidy amount  for such employees will be limited to the eligible  remuneration paid in any pay period between March 15 and June 6, 2020, up to a  maximum benefit of $847 per week or 75 per cent of the employee’s pre-crisis  weekly remuneration.</p>
<p>  There would be no  overall limit on the subsidy amount that an eligible employer may claim. </p>
<p>  Employers must  make their best effort to top-up employees’ salaries to bring them to  pre-crisis levels.</p>
<h3>Eligible Periods</h3>
<p>  Eligibility would  generally be determined by the change in an eligible employer’s monthly  revenues, year-over-year, for the calendar month in which the period began. The  amount of wage subsidy (provided under the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.html">COVID-19 Economic Response  Plan</a>) received by  the employer in a given month would be ignored for the purpose of measuring  year-over-year changes in monthly revenues.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, if revenues in March  2020 were down 50 per cent compared to March 2019, the employer would be allowed  to claim the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (as calculated above) on  remuneration paid between March&nbsp;15 and April 11, 2020.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The table  below outlines each claiming period and the period in which it has a decline in  revenue of 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent or more. </p>
 <div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-striped table-hover table-bordered table-condensed small">

    <td headers="C2 C5">May 2020 over May 2019</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody></table>
<p>For eligible employers established after  February 2019, eligibility would be determined by  comparing monthly revenues to a reasonable benchmark. </p>
<h3>  How to  Apply</h3>
<p>  Eligible employers would be able to apply for the Canada Emergency Wage  Subsidy through the Canada Revenue Agency’s <em>My  Business Account</em> portal as well as a web-based application.   Employers would have to keep records demonstrating their reduction in  arm’s-length revenues and remuneration paid to employees.  More details about the application process  will be made available shortly. </p>
<h3>  Ensuring Compliance</h3>
<p>  In order to maintain the integrity of the program and to ensure that it  helps Canadians keep their jobs, the employer would be required to repay  amounts paid under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy if they do not meet the  eligibility requirements and pay their employees accordingly.  Penalties may apply in cases of fraudulent  claims. In addition, anti‑abuse rules will  be proposed to ensure that the subsidy is not inappropriately obtained and to  ensure that employees are paid the amounts they are owed.  The government is considering proposing to  create new offences that will apply to individuals, employers or business  administrators who provide false or misleading information to obtain access to  this benefit or who misuse any funds obtained under the program.  The penalties may include fines or even  imprisonment.</p>
<h3>  Interaction  with 10 per cent Wage Subsidy</h3>
<p>  On March 18, 2020,  the Prime Minister announced a temporary 10 per cent wage subsidy. For employers  that are eligible for both the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the 10 per cent  wage subsidy for a period, any benefit from the 10 per cent wage subsidy for remuneration  paid in a specific period would generally reduce the amount available to be claimed  under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy in that same  period. </p>
<h3>  Interaction with the Canadian  Emergency Response Benefit </h3>
<p>  An employer would not be  eligible to claim the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy for remuneration paid to an  employee in a week that falls within a 4-week period for which the employee is  eligible for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit. </p>
<p>  Employers who are not  eligible for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy would still be able to furlough  employees who will receive up to $2,000 a month.</p>
<h3>  Government Assistance</h3>
<p>  The usual treatment of tax credits and other  benefits provided by the government would apply. As a consequence, the wage  subsidy received by an employer would be considered government assistance and be  included in the employer’s taxable income.</p>
<p>  Assistance received under either wage subsidy would  reduce the amount of remuneration expenses eligible for other federal tax  credits calculated on the same remuneration. </p>

<h2>How businesses will benefit from  the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy</h2>
<p>Bruno and Tisha run a floral shop in Burnaby,  British Columbia. They have four full‑time employees, each earning $800 per  week, and 6 part-time employees, each earning $400 per week, for a total weekly  payroll of $5,600. Bruno and Tisha have closed their shop and are only  fulfilling online orders during this challenging period. They are keeping all  of their employees on the payroll, paying them their full regular wages,  despite their revenues being down by 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. Bruno and Tisha would  be eligible for a weekly wage subsidy of $4,200 ($600 for each of their  full-time employees and $300 for each of their part-time employees). </p>
<h2>Canada’s  COVID-19 Economic Response Plan– Cost and Implementation </h2>
<p>  These measures are part of the Government  of Canada’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.html">COVID-19 Economic Response  Plan</a> - a comprehensive plan to help ensure that Canadians can pay  for essentials like mortgages, rent and groceries, and to help businesses  continue to pay their employees and their bills during this time of  uncertainty. </p>
