<p>Eligible employers are able to apply for the CEWS through the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) My Business Account or Represent a Client portals or by going on-line and using a Web Access Code. If you have more than one payroll account number ("RP" number) you will need to do a separate application for each number (15-digit BN). However, the application of the CEWS program rules such as the revenue test and employer eligibility is determined at the legal entity level (9-digit BN), subject to special rules for the revenue test (subsection 125.7(4)) for, for example, corporate groups and non-arm's length revenue.</p>

<p>Eligible employers will be required to keep books and records demonstrating their reduction in arm's-length revenues and remuneration paid to employees. For additional information about adequate records and recordkeeping, please see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/keeping-records/what-records-who-keep-them.html">What are records and who has to keep them?</a></p>

<p>The application requires an attestation. See information below regarding the requirements.</p>

<p>For more information about the CEWS program, please see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html">Frequently Asked Questions – Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-1">Before You Start </h2>

<ol>

<li>Ensure you have the following information, documents and records available:

<ul>

<li>Payroll Account Number (note, this number must have been obtained prior to March 16, 2020). If you have more than one payroll account number ("RP" number) you will need to do a separate application for each number.</li>

<li>Payroll Web Access Code (not required if filing via My Business Account or Represent a Client)</li>

<li>Period covered by this claim</li>

<li>Number of employees </li>

<li>Payroll information</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p>Confirm that the eligible employer qualifies for the CEWS:</p>

<p>An eligible employer includes an individual (including trusts), a corporation other than a corporation exempt from tax, a non-profit organization and a registered charity, as well as the following additional tax-exempt entities:</p>

<ul>

<li>agricultural organizations;</li>

<li>boards of trade;</li>

<li>chambers of commerce;</li>

<li>non-profit scientific research and experimental development corporations;</li>

<li>labour organizations or societies; and</li>

<li>benevolent or fraternal benefit societies or orders.</li>

</ul>

<p>A partnership will be considered an eligible employer if all of its members are eligible employers as described above.</p>

<p>A public institution such as a municipality, a local government, a Crown corporation, a public university, a college, a school, a school board, a health authority and a hospital are not eligible for the subsidy.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Review the information about calculating revenues:</p>

<p>An employer's revenue for this purpose is generally its revenue in Canada earned from arm's-length sources. Revenue is calculated using the employer's normal accounting method, and excludes revenues from extraordinary items and amounts on account of capital.</p>

<p>Employers are allowed to calculate their revenues under the accrual method or the cash method, but not a combination of both. Employers select the cash or accrual accounting method when first applying for the CEWS and are required to use that method for the entire duration of the program.</p>

<p>For registered charities and non-profit organizations, the calculation includes most forms of revenue, excluding revenues from non-arm's length persons. These organizations are allowed to choose whether or not to include revenue from government sources as part of the calculation. Once chosen, the same approach applies throughout the program period.</p>

<p>Special rules and options for the computation of revenue are provided in the CEWS program rules to take into account certain situations, including joint ventures and non-arm's length transactions, such as where an employer sells all of its output to a related company that in turn earns arm's length revenue. As well, affiliated groups are able to compute revenue on a consolidated basis. For further information, refer to the definition of "qualifying revenue" in subsection 125.7(1), and to subsection 125.7(4), of the Income Tax Act.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="h-2">Instructions on how to apply</h2>

<h3 id="number">Payroll Account Number</h3>

<p>Enter your payroll account number and two-letter code for the type of program. If you have more than one payroll account number ("RP" number) you will need to do a separate application for each number .</p>

<p>A payroll account number is a number assigned to either an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/find-if-make-payroll-deductions.html">employer</a>, a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-overview/employer-responsibilities-payroll-steps/you-a-trustee.html">trustee</a> or a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-overview/employer-responsibilities-payroll-steps/you-a-payer-other-amounts-related-employment.html">payer of other amounts related to employment</a> to identify themselves when dealing with the CRA.</p>

<p>This 15-character payroll program account number contains the nine-digit business number (BN). The BN is a unique federal government numbering system that identifies your business and the various accounts you maintain. The payroll account number consists of:</p>

<ul>

<li>the nine-digit BN</li>

<li>a two-letter code for the type of program (for payroll program, the letters are "RP")</li>

<li>a four-digit reference number to identify each account in a program a business may have</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="code">Payroll Web Access Code</h3>

<p>If you are not filing your application using My Business Account or Represent a Client, you will need to enter your BN and its associated Web Access Code. If you do not remember your code or you need a code for a new account, access the <a href="https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/leb0/wacretrieve/pub/disclaimer.action?request_locale=en">Online Web access code</a> service or call our business and self-employed individuals line at 1-800-959-5525.</p>

<h3 id="period">Period Covered by This Claim</h3>

<p>Choose one of the periods in the drop-down menu. These are the employment periods for which CEWS is available: (i.e., from March 15 to April 11, from April 12 to May 9, or from May 10 to June 6).</p>

<h3 id="business">Are you the Business Owner or an Authorized Representative?</h3>

<p>If you are applying using a Web Access Code you will need to identify if you are the "<strong>business owner</strong>" or an "<strong>authorized representative</strong>".</p>

<p>The web application must be completed by the person who is "the individual who has principal responsibility for the financial activities" of the employer. This may be the business owner or an employee of the business. This could be a Chief Financial Officer, a Vice-President, an accountant, or another senior employee who manages the employer's finances. This individual will be the person who completes the attestation required by the CEWS program rules. If you are completing the attestation for the CEWS application as the business owner or as an employee of the business owner, pick "<strong>business owner</strong>".</p>

<p>The web application may also be completed by an authorized representative such as a professional tax advisor or a tax preparer. In this case, the authorized representative must certify that the prescribed attestation has been completed by the person who has principal responsibility for the financial activities of the employer. If you are completing the application as an authorized representative of an employer pick "<strong>authorized representative</strong>".</p>

<h3 id="line-a"><span>Line A - Number of eligible employees</span></h3>

<p>Enter the number of eligible employees you had on your payroll during the period covered by this claim in the box for line A.</p>
<div id="line-a-content">
<p>An eligible employee is an individual who is employed in Canada. Eligibility for the CEWS of an employee's remuneration, will be limited to employees that have not been without remuneration for more than 14 consecutive days in the eligibility period, i.e., from March 15 to April 11, from April 12 to May 9, and from May 10 to June 6. That is, if the employer laid off or otherwise did not pay an employee, and did not retroactively re-hire them – and that was the situation for over 14 days in the eligibility period, the employer cannot count that employee as an eligible employee.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="line-b"><span>Line B – Total eligible remuneration paid </span></h3>

<p>Enter the total eligible remuneration paid during the period of this claim in the box for line B.</p>
<div id="line-b-content">
<p>Eligible remuneration of an eligible employee means amounts received as salary, wages, and certain other remuneration like fees, commissions or other amounts for services.</p>

<p>The following amounts are not considered eligible remuneration:</p>

<ul>

<li>a retiring allowance; </li>

<li>stock option benefits; </li>

<li>any amount received that can reasonably be expected to be paid or returned, directly or indirectly, to the eligible employer or to a person (including a partnership) with whom the eligible employer does not deal at arm's length;</li>

<li>any amount that is paid in respect of a week in the claim period, if, as part of an arrangement involving the eligible employee and the eligible employer:

<ul>

<li>the amount is in excess of the eligible employee's baseline remuneration,</li>

<li>after the claim period, the eligible employee is reasonably expected to be paid a lower weekly amount than their baseline remuneration, and</li>

<li>one of the main purposes for the arrangement is to increase the amount of the CEWS.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>These last two exclusions are directed at preventing schemes to inflate CEWS payments.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="rehire">Did you retroactively rehire one or more employees during this period? </h3>

<p>Employers may retroactively re-hire employees and use the CEWS program to help pay the related wages. Employees who are retroactively rehired by their employer for the same period may not be eligible to receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). As a result, we encourage employers to communicate with employees that they may be required to repay some or all of the CERB to the Government of Canada.</p>

<p>Select "<strong>Yes</strong>", if you did retroactively rehire one or more employees during the period covered by this claim. Select "<strong>No</strong>", if you did not retroactively rehire during this period. This information will help the government with the administration of the CERB.</p>

<h3 id="line-c"><span>Line C – Basic Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy </span></h3>
<div id="line-c-content">
<p>The CEWS is based on the number and type of employees you have, and the amount and type of pay they received before and during the COVID-19 crisis. The basic maximum is $847 per week. This will generally be the amount for employees who earn $1,129.33 a week <strong>or more</strong>. For employees who earn less than $1,129.32 a week, the amount of the CEWS subsidy is generally 75% of the employee's weekly pay. Employers are also eligible for a subsidy of up to 75% of salaries and wages paid to new employees. Special rules apply in certain situations, including for "non-arm's length" employees. In general terms, these are employees such as the business owner or his or her family members. For these employees, the CEWS is limited to the least of the following amounts:</p>

<ul>

<li>75% of "baseline remuneration" (in general terms, average weekly pay for the employee during the period January 1, 2020 to March 15, 2020) </li>

<li>$847</li>

<li>the amount of eligible remuneration paid for the week</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>The CRA has prepared an <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-calculate-subsidy-amount.html">online calculator</a> to illustrate how to calculate the amount of CEWS that you are entitled to for most situations. The CEWS program rules in the Income Tax Act apply to determine the amount of CEWS entitlement. Once calculated, enter the base CEWS in the box for line C.</p>

<h3 id="line-d"><span>Line D – Employer's EI and QPIP premiums payable on salary paid to furloughed employees (enter $0 if not applicable)</span> </h3>

<p>Enter the employer's Employment Insurance (EI) or Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) contributions for furloughed employees (employees on leave with full or partial pay) for the relevant period in the box for line D.</p>
<div id="line-d-content">
<p>This refund would apply to the entire amount of employer-paid contributions in respect of remuneration paid to furloughed employees in a period where the employer is eligible for the CEWS.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="line-e"><span>Line E - Employer's CPP and QPP contributions payable on salary paid to furloughed employees (enter $0 if not applicable)</span> </h3>

<p>Enter the employer's Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or (Quebec Pension Plan) QPP contributions for furloughed employees (employees on leave with full or partial pay) for the relevant period in the box for line E.</p>
<div id="line-e-content">
<p>This refund would apply to the entire amount of employer-paid contributions in respect of remuneration paid to furloughed employees in a period where the employer is eligible for the CEWS.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="line-f"><span>Line F – 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy reduction for employers</span> </h3>
<div id="line-f-content">
<p>The 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy for Employers reduces the amount of income tax source deductions that employers have to remit to CRA on behalf of their employees by up to 10% of their remuneration (to a maximum of $1,375 per employee up to $25,000 per employer). Many employers that qualify for the CEWS also qualify for the 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy for Employers.</p>

<p>Under the new rules, the government made the 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy work automatically by creating a new law that says that employers who qualify are "deemed" to have sent in too much money to the CRA for income tax source deductions on behalf of their employees. Some employers took advantage of this right away by reducing the amount of income tax that they sent to the CRA on behalf of employees. Other employers have not done anything yet.</p>

<p>CEWS and the 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy for Employers are intended to provide total support of up to 75% for payroll, not 75% + 10%. If you did not reduce the source deductions you remitted to the CRA, but you were entitled to the 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy for Employers, the CRA will treat you as having over-remitted your employee source deductions (so that normally you will be entitled to a refund). The CRA will require you to fill out a self-identification form, that will be published in the coming months, in order for us to credit your payroll program account by the amount of the subsidy. In all cases, if you are eligible for the 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy, you must put the amount that you are eligible for in the box for line F, whether or not you have taken advantage of it.</p>

<h3 id="line-g"><span>Line G – Amounts received by eligible employees under the ESDC's Work Sharing Benefit program (enter $0 if not applicable)</span></h3>
<div id="line-g-content">
<p>For employers and employees that are participating in Employment and Social Development Canada's <a href="/en/employment-social-development/corporate/notices/coronavirus/employers-factsheet.html">Work-Sharing benefit program</a>, EI benefits received by employees through the Work-Sharing program will reduce the benefit that their employer is entitled to receive under the CEWS.</p>

<h3 id="attestation">Attestation </h3>

<p>Attestation is the act of signing of a formal document to confirm that you are bound by its contents.</p>

<p>If you are the individual with principal responsibility for the financial activities of the employer making the claim, you must complete and submit the Attestation for Business owners.</p>

<p>Representatives need to attest by completing and submitting the Attestation for Representatives. Representatives also need to obtain a signed attestation using the prescribed form (electronic signature permitted) from the individual who has principal responsibility of the financial activities of the eligible entity (the employer). The CRA can request to see the signed copy of the prescribed attestation at any time. The representative agrees that it will be provided upon request and without delay in prescribed form and manner, and that failure to do so could result in the application of penalties or the reassessment of the claim to deny benefits.</p>

<p>Penalties may also apply in cases of fraudulent claims. The penalties may include fines or even imprisonment.</p>

<p>In addition, if an employer knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence makes, or is involved in the making of, a false statement or omission in its CEWS application for a claim period, the employer is liable to a penalty – commonly referred to as the “gross negligence penalty” – of up to 50% of the difference between the amount of CEWS that it claimed in its application and the amount of CEWS to which it is actually entitled. </p>
