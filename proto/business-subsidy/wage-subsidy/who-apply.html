	  <p><mark>Does this (and eligible revenue below) belong here or elsewhere?</mark></p>
			<p>To qualify for and find the amount of your wage subsidy, you will need to calculate your claim period revenue drop for each claim period.</p>
			<p>For periods 22 and later, you also need to know your <strong>12-month average revenue drop</strong>.</p>
	  <h3>Calculating your claim period revenue drop</h3>
	  		  <p>You can <a href=""><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> use the online calculator or spreadsheet to calculate your claim period revenue drop</a>.</p>
	  <p>Or, read the details of how the claim period revenue drop is calculated.</p>
	  <details><summary>How the claim period revenue drop is calculated</summary>
				  <p>

   <pYour claim period revenue drop is the decline in eligible revenue you experienced when comparing your claim period revenue with your revenue from a specific period of time prior to March 2020 (the “prior reference period”):</p>
   <p><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> <strong>Revenue drop (%) = 1 – (Claim period revenue / prior reference period revenue)</strong></p>
   <h4 id="deeming">Using the current or prior claim period revenue drop (the “deeming rule”)</h4>
   <p>As of claim period 5, you calculate two revenue drops and use the higher result in your base rate calculation. If you use the <a href="">online calculator or spreadsheet</a> to calculate your subsidy amount, both rates will be calculated when you enter your revenues and the higher rate will automatically be applied.</p>

   <p>You must choose one of these prior reference period options and use it when calculating your revenue drop for both the base rate and top-up rate for all claims in periods 5 and later. However:</p>
   <ul>
	<!--<li>if you used one approach for claims you made in periods 1 to 4, you may switch to the other option beginning with your claim in period 5</li>-->
	<li>if you were not operating on March 1, 2019, you may elect to use the alternative approach for CEWS claim periods 14 to 17, even if you used the general approach for prior claims</li>
	 </ul>
   <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you choose to use the alternative prior reference period (January and February 2020), you need to check the "prior reference period" election box when completing your subsidy application form.</p>

  	<p>Your 12-month average revenue drop is the average decline in revenue you experienced in each of the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to February 2020).</p>
