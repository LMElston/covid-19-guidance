    <!--FLAG TO ARCHIVE <p>For <strong>claim periods 1 to 4</strong>, you can’t include employees who had 14 or more consecutive unpaid days in the period.</p>
    <p>For periods 5 and later, you may include these employees in your calculation.</p>-->
    <p>Employee eligibility depends on the person being <mark><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html#q13-1">employed in Canada, not living in Canada</a></mark>.</p>
    <h3 id="retro">Retroactively hiring and paying employees</h3>
    <p>Employees you laid off can become eligible retroactively, as long as you rehire and pay them so they meet the eligibility criteria for the claim period. You must rehire and pay these employees before you include them in your subsidy claim.</p>

	    <p><strong>For CEWS claim periods 5 to 19</strong>, employees on leave with pay are treated differently than active employees when calculating your subsidy amount.

      <p>If your pay schedule doesn’t align with the wage subsidy claim period dates, you will have to manually calculate how much you paid the employee in respect of each week.

          <p>This means the period covered by the remuneration payment. For example, if the pre-crisis pay period selected is January 1 to March 15, 2020, and the employee is paid monthly on the 16th of every month (for hours worked the previous month), there would be two pays in that period. The January 16th pay would cover the period from Dec 1 to 31, 2019 (31 days) and the February 16th pay would cover January 1 to 31, 2020 (31 days). </p>
