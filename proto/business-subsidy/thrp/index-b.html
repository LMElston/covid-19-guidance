    <p>As a Canadian employer in the tourism or hospitality industry who has been affected by COVID-19, you may be eligible for wage and rent subsidies through the Tourism and Hospitality.</p>
			
	<h2>Tourism and hospitality industry</h2>
	<p>Additional details on the definition of qualifying organizations within this category will be forthcoming.</p>
	<p>Examples of eligible organizations in the tourism and hospitality industry include hotels, restaurants, bars, festivals, travel agencies, tour operators, convention centres, convention and trade show organizations must, and others.</p>
		
	<h2>Demonstrate a sustained revenue loss</h2>
	<p>Eligible organizations would also be required to demonstrate they were deeply affected by the pandemic by meeting the following two conditions to qualify for this program:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>An average monthly revenue  reduction of at least <strong>40 percent</strong> over  the first 13 qualifying periods for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (<em>12-month revenue decline</em>); and</li>
		<li>A current-month revenue  loss of at least <strong>40 percent</strong>. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>The 12-month revenue decline would be calculated as the average of all revenue decline percentages for eligible organizations from March 2020 to February 2021 (claim periods 1-13, excluding claim period 10 or 11). Any periods in which an entity was not carrying on its ordinary operations for reasons other than a public health restriction (for example, because it is a seasonal business) would be excluded from this calculation. The existing rules would continue to apply for the purposes of calculating the current-month revenue decline.</p>
