				<p>Eligible organizations would also be required to demonstrate they were deeply affected by the pandemic by meeting the following two conditions to qualify for this program:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>An average monthly revenue  reduction of at least <strong>40 percent</strong> over  the first 13 qualifying periods for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (<em>12-month revenue decline</em>); and</li>
					<li>A current-month revenue  loss of at least <strong>40 percent</strong>. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>The 12-month revenue decline would be calculated as the average of all revenue decline percentages for eligible organizations from March 2020 to February 2021 (claim periods 1-13, excluding claim period 10 or 11). Any periods in which an entity was not carrying on its ordinary operations for reasons other than a public health restriction (for example, because it is a seasonal business) would be excluded from this calculation. The existing rules would continue to apply for the purposes of calculating the current-month revenue decline.</p>
