			<h2 id="potential-vacc-supplies">Potential vaccines and supplies</h2>
 <p>Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), Health Canada and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada to identify and procure potential vaccine candidates and supplies.</p>
 <p>On behalf of the <abbr title="Public Health Agency of Canada">PHAC</abbr>, and based on advice from the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr> is leading negotiations and finalizing agreements with suppliers of COVID-19 vaccine candidates.</p>
 <p>Vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials, and will require Health Canada authorization prior to being used to vaccinate Canadians.</p>
 <h2 id="agreements">Vaccine agreements</h2>
 <p>To date, the Government of Canada has invested over $1 billion to secure access to promising vaccine candidates.</p>
 <p>This includes up-front payments that companies require to support vaccine development, testing, and at-risk manufacturing. Subsequent payments are contingent on vaccines passing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval.</p>
 <p>These investments guarantee Canada’s earliest possible access to the production of an approved COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
 <p>Agreements have been signed with the following suppliers:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/09/25/new-agreements-secure-additional-vaccine-candidates-covid-19">AstraZeneca</a>: Up to 20&nbsp;million doses</li>

   <li><a href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/08/31/new-measures-ensure-supply-future-vaccines-and-therapies-against">Novavax</a>: Up to 76&nbsp;million doses</li>

 </ul>
 <p>All of the vaccine candidates for which Canada has agreements are a two-dose vaccine, with the exception of the Johnson &amp; Johnson candidate, which is a one-dose vaccine.</p>
 <h3>More information on vaccine agreements</h3>
 <p><a href="https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/medias-media/2020-11-19-00-eng.html">Public Services and Procurement Canada has signed agreements with seven companies to secure access to seven COVID-19 vaccine candidates</a></p>
 <h3>COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility</h3>
 <p>The Government of Canada is also participating in the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility, a global procurement mechanism that will help develop and deliver safe, equitable and accessible COVID-19 vaccines. Participation in the <abbr title="COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access">COVAX</abbr> facility also gives Canada access to 6&nbsp;additional vaccine candidates.</p>
 <p>The Government of Canada is committing approximately $220&nbsp;million to the facility to procure up to 15 million vaccine doses for Canadians. An additional $220&nbsp;million will be channeled through the <abbr title="COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access">COVAX</abbr> Advance Market Commitment to purchase doses for low and middle-income countries, increasing their access to a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
 <h2 id="related-procs">Vaccine related procurements</h2>
 <p>The Government of Canada also continues to purchase the necessary supplies for the administration of different vaccines. Contracts are in place for personal protective equipment and ancillary supplies such as:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>needles</li>
   <li>syringes</li>
   <li>swabs</li>
   <li>gauze</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>More contracting information for these and other COVID-19 supplies</h3>

 <h3>End-to-end logistics</h3>
 <p><abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr> is also working to contract one or more logistics service providers that will support <abbr title="Public Health Agency of Canada">PHAC</abbr> in the physical distribution of vaccines to provincial and territorial authorities or points of administration.</p>
 <p>Following the <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-20-00932673">Invitation to Qualify process for an end-to-end logistics solution</a> for COVID-19 vaccines, a Request for Proposals was issued directly to the four <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-20-00933946">prequalified bidders</a>.

   <li>Kuehn + Nagel Ltd.</li>
   <li>McKesson Canada Corporation</li>
   <li>UPS Healthcare</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Given the complexity of the eventual distribution of vaccines, such as the need to transport and store vaccines at specific temperatures, <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr> is also procuring other goods and services required to support the eventual distribution of a vaccine to Canadians.</p>
 <ul>
   <li><abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>, on behalf of <abbr title="Public Health Agency of Canada">PHAC</abbr>, awarded a contract to Fisher Scientific, valued at $1,144,032.33, and to ESBE Scientific, valued at $868,944.07, for the purchase of 26 freezers at -80 degrees Celsius and 100 freezers at -20 degrees Celsius</li>
