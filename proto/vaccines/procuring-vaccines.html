			<h2 id="h">How COVID-19 spreads</h2>
			<p>COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols created when an
				infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, shouts, or talks. The droplets vary in size from large droplets that fall
				to the ground rapidly (within seconds or minutes) near the infected person, to smaller droplets, sometimes called
				aerosols, which linger in the air undersome circumstances.</p>
			<p>The relative infectiousness of droplets of different sizes is not clear. Infectious droplets or aerosols may come
				into direct contact with the mucous membranes of another person's nose,
				mouth or eyes, or they may be inhaled into their nose, mouth, airways and lungs. The virus mayalso spread when a
				person touches another person (i.e., a handshake) or a surface or an object (also referred to as a fomite) that
				has the virus on it, and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands.</p>
			<p>Learn more about <a
					href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/main-modes-transmission.html">modes
					of transmission of COVID-19</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="self">Difference between quarantine and isolate</h2>
			<p>People are asked to quarantine or isolate to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others. Although these two
				words are often thought to mean the same thing, there's an important difference.</p>
			<h3 id="q">Quarantine</h3>
			<p>If you have <strong>no symptoms</strong> and any of the following apply to you, you must quarantine for 14 days
				(starting from the date you arrive in Canada):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you're returning from travel <strong>outside of Canada</strong> (mandatory quarantine)</li>
				<li>you're travelling to a <a
						href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">province
						or territory</a> <strong>that's enforcing 14-day quarantine</strong> for all inter-provincial travellers</li>
				<li>you had close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19</li>
				<li>you've been told by the public health authority that you may have been exposed to COVID-19 and need to
					quarantine</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="iso">Isolate</h3>
			<p>You must isolate if <strong>any</strong> of the following apply:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you've been diagnosed with COVID-19, or are waiting to hear the results of a lab test for COVID-19</li>
				<li>you have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild, and you've been: <ul>
						<li> in contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19</li>
						<li> told by public health that you may have been exposed to COVID-19</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>you've returned from travel outside Canada with symptoms of COVID-19 (mandatory)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="p">Preventing COVID-19</h2>
			<h3>Vaccination for COVID-19</h3>
			<p>Research and development are underway for a COVID-19 vaccine. </p>
			<p>The Government of Canada is closely tracking all potential drugs and vaccines in development in Canada and
				abroad. To help speed up the development and availability of treatments as well as vaccines to prevent COVID-19,
				Canada is working with:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>companies</li>
				<li>academic research centres</li>
				<li>investigators</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Find out <a
					href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/awareness-resources/know-vaccine.html">what
					you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccinefor Canada</a>.</p>
			<h4>Who will receive early COVID-19 vaccination</h4>
			<p>The Government of Canada is working with provincial and territorial governments on plansto allocate, distribute,
				administer, and monitor COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
			<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is an external, expert advisory group that assesses the
				scientific evidence and makes recommendations to the Public Health Agency of Canada on the use of vaccines
				currently or newly approved for use in Canada, on who should receive vaccine and how it should be administered.
				NACI’s preliminary guidance on key populations for early COVID-19 immunization has been released.</p>
			<p>Their guidance will help inform federal, provincial and territorial governments decisions onhow to roll out
				COVID-19 vaccine programs once Canada has access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
			<p>Important decisions are being made across all levels of government on how to use what vaccine supply is available
				because we know there will be limited supply at first—to make the most impact and to protect key populations.</p>
			<p>NACI recommends the following populations should be prioritized for early COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Those at high risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19, including those at an advanced age or with other
					high-risk conditions.</li>
				<li>Those most likely to transmit COVID-19 to those at high risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 and
					workers essential to maintaining the COVID-19 response.</li>
				<li>Those contributing to the maintenance or other essential services for the functioning of society.</li>
				<li>Those whose living or working conditions put them at elevated risk of infection and where infection could have
					disproportionate consequences, including Indigenous communities.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Flu vaccine</h4>
			<p>Getting your <a href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza/get-your-flu-shot.html">annual flu
					shot</a> is the best way to protect yourself, your family and people at high risk of complications from the flu.
				It will help: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>protect your community </li>
				<li>reduce the burden on Canada’s health care system during the pandemic </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The flu shot will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;protect against COVID-19, but it will help reduce your risk of
				getting the flu and COVID-19 at the same time. Having both illnesses
				at the same time could put you at a higher risk for severe complications. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Getting the flu shot will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;increase your risk of illness from COVID-19. For more
				information, please refer to this <a
					href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa626/5842161">Canadian research study</a>.

			<h3>Follow public health measures</h3>
			<p>Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the
				spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Measures to <a
					href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/measures-reduce-community.html">reduce
					COVID-19 in your community</a> are especially important as some areas begin to lift restrictions.</p>
			<p>In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within communities and across the country, all Canadians are
				advised to avoid or keep exposure very brief.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Avoid closed spaces, crowded places, close contact settings and close-range conversation orsettings where
					there's: <ul>
						<li>singing</li>
						<li>shouting</li>
						<li>heavy breathing (for example, during exercise)</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Stay home and away from others if you feel sick.</li>
				<li>Keep the number of people you have prolonged contact with as small as possible.</li>
				<li>Stick to a small and consistent social circle and avoid gathering in large groups.</li>
				<li>Talk to your employer about working at home if possible.</li>
				<li>Limit contact with <a

				</li>
				<li>Go outside to exercise.</li>
				<li>Maintain a physical distance of 2 metres from people outside of your household.
					<ul>
						<li>Household contacts (people you live with) don't need to distance from each other unless they're sick or

			<h2 id="r">Risks of getting COVID-19</h2>
			<p>The risk of getting COVID-19 is evolving daily and varies between and within communities. Overall, the risk to
				Canadians remains <strong>high</strong>. This doesn't mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that
				there's already a significant impact on our health care system.</p>
			<p>To stay healthy and to protect ourselves and others, we must be mindful of the ever-present risk of exposure to
				the virus. Some settings and situations increase the risk, such as being in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>closed spaces</li>
				<li>crowded places</li>
				<li>close-contact settings where you can't keep 2 metres apart from each other</li>
				<li>close-range conversations</li>
				<li>settings where there's singing, shouting or heavy breathing (for example, during exercise)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It's particularly important to avoid settings where these risks overlap, such as closed spaces and crowded spaces
				where close-range conversations occur.</p>

				</summary>
				<p>It's not certain how long the virus survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses.
					Research suggests that the virus may live on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days depending on:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>temperature</li>
					<li>type of surface</li>
					<li>humidity of the environment</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Surfaces frequently touched with your own hands or other peoples hands are most likely to
					become contaminated, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>tables</li>
					<li>phones</li>
					<li>handrails</li>
					<li>doorknobs</li>
					<li>credit cards</li>
					<li>countertops</li>
					<li>light switches</li>
					<li>faucet handles</li>
					<li>steering wheel</li>
					<li>cabinet handles</li>
					<li>elevator buttons</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Packages that you receive in the mail may be contaminated, but because parcels generally take a few days to be
					delivered, the risk of spread is <strong>low</strong>.</p>
				<p>To protect yourself from COVID-19, make sure to do the following when handling products shipped within or
					outside of Canada:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after handling the package</li>
					<li>avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially with unwashed hands</li>

				<p>Sexual health is an important part of overall health. But sex can be complicated in the time of COVID-19 for:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>intimate partners not part of the same household bubble</li>
					<li>those who are or whose partner is: <ul>
							<li><a
									href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/people-high-risk-for-severe-illness-covid-19.html">at
									higher risk of more severe disease or outcomes of COVID-19</a></li>
							<li><a
									href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/vulnerable-populations-covid-19.html">at
									higher risk for COVID-19 due to work, living situation or other life circumstances</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Because COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets, kissing is a high-risk activity. Even if no one's
					showing <a
						href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#s">symptoms</a>,
					sexual activity with partners outside of your small, consistent and trusted contact bubble increases your risk
					of getting or spreading COVID-19. However, current evidence indicates there's a very low likelihood of getting
					COVID-19 through semen or vaginal fluids.</p>
				<p>If having sex with someone outside of your small, consistent and trusted contact bubble, reduce the risk to
					yourself and others.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Monitor yourself for COVID-19 symptoms, and stay home and avoid sex if you or a partnerare experiencing
						them.</li>
					<li>Limit the use of alcohol and other substances so you and a partner are able to make safe decisions.</li>
					<li>Avoid kissing and face-to-face contact or closeness.</li>
					<li>Consider using a non-medical mask that covers your nose and mouth.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In addition to COVID-19 prevention measures, always <a
						href="https://www.canada/en/public-health/services/sexual-health/safer-condom-use.html">engage in safe sex practices</a>. This
					includes using condoms, and knowing both your own and a partner's sexually transmitted infection status.</p>
