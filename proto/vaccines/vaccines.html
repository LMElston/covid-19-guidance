        <p>COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.</p>
<p>Free vaccines will be available to everyone in Canada over the course of 2021.</p>

        <p>Until extensive immunization is achieved, public health measures will continue to be essential to minimize the spread of
        COVID-19 in Canada and save lives.</p>

        <h2 id="a1">Authorized COVID-19 vaccines in Canada</h2>

        <p>Canada’s independent authorization process is recognized around the world for its high standards and rigorous review. The approval of the vaccine is supported by evidence that it is safe, effective and of good quality.</p>
        <p>Get more information on authorized vaccines, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>ingredients and allergies</li>
            <li>how they work</li>
            <li>how they're given</li>
            <li>possible side effects</li>

            </ul>

        <h2 id="a2">Who will get vaccinated first</h2>

        <p>Everyone in Canada will have access to a safe, effective and free COVID-19 vaccine in 2021.</p>
        <p>Vaccination has started and will be expanded to the entire population throughout 2021 as vaccine supply increases.</p>

        <p>Doses for the whole population will arrive at different times. A phased approach to vaccine delivery will begin with the
        arrival of limited doses, which will be prioritized for high-risk people:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>residents and staff of shared living settings that provide care for seniors</li>
            <li>adults 70 years of age and older, beginning with adults 80 years of age and older, and then decreasing the age limit by
            5-year increments to age 70 years as supply becomes available</li>
            <li>health care workers who have direct contact with patients, including those who work in health care settings and personal
            support workers</li>
            <li>adults in <a href="https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1606941379837/1606941507767">Indigenous communities</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>As additional COVID-19 vaccine(s) and supplies become available, the following populations should be offered
        vaccinations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>health care workers not included in the initial rollout</li>
            <li>residents and staff of all other shared living settings, such as homeless shelters, correctional facilities, and housing
            for migrant workers</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/crtcl-nfrstrctr/esf-sfe-en.aspx">essential workers</a> who face additional risks to maintain services for the functioning of society</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="a3">Monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness</h2>
        <p>Health Canada monitors the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>our monitoring and assessment activities of emerging safety issues, and</li>
            <li>collaboration and information-sharing with our partners here in Canada and around the world, such as the World Health
            Organization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="a4">Securing vaccines for everyone in Canada</h2>

        <p>We're working with provinces, territories, First Nations, Inuit and Métis leaders to make sure doses are available to
        everyone in Canada as soon as possible. We are using established vaccination programs that are in place across the
        country for a wide range of illnesses.</p>
