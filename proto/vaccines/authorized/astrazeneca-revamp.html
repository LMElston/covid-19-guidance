			<h2 id="general">Who should get vaccinated</h2>

		<p>The vaccine is approved for people who are 18 years of age and older. Its safety and effectiveness in people younger than 18 years of age have not yet been established.</p>

			<div class="mrgn-tp-sm"><a href="get-vaccinated.html" class="btn btn-call-to-action" rel="external">How to get vaccinated near you</a></div>

			<h3>When to consult with your doctor</h2>
	<p>Consult with your doctor or health care provider if you:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>have questions or concerns about vaccination</li>
	  <li>are unsure if you should receive the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
	  <li>are immunocompromised due to a disease or treatment, such as chemotherapy</li>
	  <li>have an autoimmune condition</li>
	  <li>are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
	  <li>have a severe allergy to an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
	  <li>have experienced mild to moderate immediate allergic reactions after a previous dose of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine</li>
	  <li>are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19</li>
	  <li>have a bleeding disorder</li>
	</ul>




			<h2 id="effectiveness">Effectiveness and dosage</h2>

			<p>Vaccines protect you by:</p>
			<ul class="fa-ul">
			  <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>reducing the community transmission of the virus</li>
			  <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>reducing your risk of contracting COVID-19</li>
			  <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>reducing your risk of serious illness from COVID-19</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Effectiveness in clinical trials</h3>
			<p>Clinical trials showed that, beginning 2 weeks after the second dose, the AstraZeneca COVID-19 was about 62% effective against COVID-19.</p>

			<p>Learn more about the data reviewed by Health Canada:</p>

		</ul>

			<h3>Vaccine dosage</h2>

			<p>This vaccine requires <strong>2 doses</strong> for maximum protection.</p>

			<p>The vaccination schedule approved by Health Canada is to give the two doses 4 to 12 weeks apart, based on evidence from clinical trials.</p>

			<p>Your province or territory decides when people receive their first and second doses of the vaccine. <strong>Your second dose may be delayed</strong> to allow more people to get their first dose.

			<p>These decisions are based on public health recommendations and the latest evidence.</p>

			<h2 id="side_effects">Possible side effects</h2>
			<p>After getting vaccinated, it's common and normal to have <strong>temporary</strong> side effects. These can last a <strong>few hours to a few days</strong> after vaccination.</p>
<p>This is the body's natural response, as it's working hard to build

		<h3><mark>Reports of extremely rare blood clots</mark></h3>

	<h2 id="authorization">Vaccine review and approval</h2>

	<p>Health Canada's independent drug review process is recognized around the world for its high standards and rigor. Our decisions are based only on scientific and medical evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective. The benefits must also outweigh any risks.</p>

	<p>Find detailed technical information such as the product monograph and the regulatory decision summary:</p>

<!--
		<h2 id="a5">Vaccine safety after authorization</h2>
		<p>As for all medicines, Health Canada will continue to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/regulatory-response-health-product-access.html#a8">monitor
				the safety</a> of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Canada closely. Along with the Public Health Agency of
			Canada and working in close collaboration with the provinces and territories and the manufacturer, we will monitor
			for any adverse events that may develop after immunization.</p>
		<p>Once the product is on the market, the manufacturer (Pfizer Canada ULC and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH) is
			legally required to submit reports of adverse events to Health Canada.</p>
		<p>The manufacturer is planning to follow clinical trial participants for at least 2 years after the second dose of
			the vaccine is given. It must communicate any potential safety concerns to Health Canada.</p>
		<p>To ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks, we may also impose terms and
			conditions at any time. For example, we can require the manufacturer to take further risk mitigation measures. We
			can also ask the manufacturer to submit additional safety information.</p>
		<p>Health Canada will continue to review all the available safety data as it becomes available. We will take
			appropriate action, if required, to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</p>
