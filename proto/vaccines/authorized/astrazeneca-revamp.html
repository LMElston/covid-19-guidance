			<h3>Effectiveness</h3>
			<p>Clinical trials showed that, beginning 2 weeks after the second dose, the AstraZeneca COVID-19 was about 62% effective against COVID-19.</p>

			<p>Learn more about the data reviewed by Health Canada:</p>

			<h3>Dosage</h3>

			<p>This vaccine requires <strong>2 doses</strong> for maximum protection.</p>

			<p>The dosing schedule approved by Health Canada is to give the two doses 4 to 12 weeks apart, based on evidence from clinical trials.</p>

			<p>Your province or territory decides when people receive their first and second doses of the vaccine. <strong>Your second dose may be delayed</strong> to allow more people to get their first dose.

			<p>These decisions are based on public health recommendations and the latest evidence.</p>

			<h3>Mixing vaccines</h3>
			<p>Studies are currently underway to understand if the second vaccine dose (booster) could be from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech.  At this time, mixing vaccines between the first and second dose has not been approved.

<h3 id="allergies">Allergic reactions
</h3>

<p>Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are <strong>very rare</strong>. </p>

<p>An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen© or if they must go to the hospital.</p>


	<p>Signs
  of an anaphylactic allergic reaction may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>hives (bumps on the skin that are often very itchy)</li>
  <li>swelling of the face, tongue or throat</li>
  <li>difficulty breathing</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  Call <strong>911</strong> if you develop any symptoms that could be an anaphylactic allergic reaction.</p>

		<h3>Reports of rare blood clots with low platelets</h3>
				<p>For most people, the risks associated with getting COVID-19 far outweigh the risks of a blood clot. However, rare cases of blood clots with low platelets have been reported following vaccination with this vaccine. Blood clots with low platelets differ from regular blood clots…  </p>

				<p>Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms within a month of getting vaccinated:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>shortness of breath</li>
					<li>chest pain</li>
					<li>leg swelling</li>
					<li>neurological symptoms like persistent headaches</li>
					</ul>



				<p>Your province or territory decides who can get which vaccine and when.</p>

				<p>These decisions are based on public health recommendations and the latest evidence.</p>

				<li><a href="#">Find out how provinces and territories are making COVID-19 vaccine decisions</a></li>

				<h3>Reporting a possible serious reaction</h3>
				<p>You should report any serious reactions or side effects to your health
				  care provider. Reported side effects to COVID-19
				  vaccines are published weekly:</p>

	<h2 id="authorization">Vaccine review and approval</h2>

	<p>Health Canada's independent drug review process is recognized around the world for its high standards and rigor. Our decisions are based only on scientific and medical evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective. The benefits must also outweigh any risks.</p>

	<p>Find detailed technical information such as the product monograph and the regulatory decision summary:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/product-details">AstraZeneca vaccine regulatory authorization</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/covishield/product-details">COVISHIELD vaccine regulatory authorization</a></li>
		</ul>

<!--
		<h2 id="a5">Vaccine safety after authorization</h2>
		<p>As for all medicines, Health Canada will continue to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/regulatory-response-health-product-access.html#a8">monitor
				the safety</a> of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Canada closely. Along with the Public Health Agency of
			Canada and working in close collaboration with the provinces and territories and the manufacturer, we will monitor
			for any adverse events that may develop after immunization.</p>
		<p>Once the product is on the market, the manufacturer (Pfizer Canada ULC and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH) is
			legally required to submit reports of adverse events to Health Canada.</p>
		<p>The manufacturer is planning to follow clinical trial participants for at least 2 years after the second dose of
			the vaccine is given. It must communicate any potential safety concerns to Health Canada.</p>
		<p>To ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks, we may also impose terms and
			conditions at any time. For example, we can require the manufacturer to take further risk mitigation measures. We
			can also ask the manufacturer to submit additional safety information.</p>
		<p>Health Canada will continue to review all the available safety data as it becomes available. We will take
			appropriate action, if required, to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</p>
