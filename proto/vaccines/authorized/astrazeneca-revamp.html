			<h2 id="general">Who should get vaccinated</h2>

		<p>The vaccine is approved for people who are 18 years of age and older. Its safety and effectiveness in people younger than 18 years of age have not yet been established.</p>

			<div class="mrgn-tp-sm"><a href="get-vaccinated.html" class="btn btn-call-to-action" rel="external">How to get vaccinated near you</a></div>

			<h3>When to consult with your doctor</h2>
	<p>Consult with your doctor or health care provider if you:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>have questions or concerns about vaccination</li>
	  <li>are unsure if you should receive the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
	  <li>are immunocompromised due to a disease or treatment, such as chemotherapy</li>
	  <li>have an autoimmune condition</li>
	  <li>are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
	  <li>have a severe allergy to an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
	  <li>have experienced mild to moderate immediate allergic reactions after a previous dose of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine</li>
	  <li>are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19</li>
	  <li>have a bleeding disorder</li>
	</ul>




			<h2 id="effectiveness">Effectiveness and dosage</h2>

			<p>Vaccines protect you by:</p>
			<ul class="fa-ul">
			  <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>reducing the community transmission of the virus</li>
			  <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>reducing your risk of contracting COVID-19</li>
			  <li><span class="fa fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>reducing your risk of serious illness from COVID-19</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Effectiveness in clinical trials</h3>
			<p>The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine showed an effectiveness of about 62% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease beginning 2 weeks after the second dose.</p>
			<!--
			 This means that people may not be protected against COVID-19 disease until at least 7 days after the second dose.</p>
			 -->
			<h3>Vaccine dosage</h2>

			<p>This vaccine requires <strong>2 doses</strong>.</p>

			<p>The manufacturer's recommendation, as authorized by Health Canada, is to give the two doses 4 to 12 weeks apart.</p>

			<p>Based on real world effectiveness and public health recommendations, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended <strong>delaying the 2nd dose</strong>. This recommendation allows for a quicker rollout of the vaccine, making it possible to have more people getting the protection given by the first dose of the vaccine.</p>

			</ul>

		<p>Your province or territory makes the final determination about when people receive their first and second doses of the vaccine. </p>

<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2 id="side_effects">Possible side effects</h2>
			<p>After getting vaccinated, it's common and normal to have <strong>temporary</strong> side effects. These can last a <strong>few hours to a few days</strong> after vaccination.</p>
<p>This is the body's natural response, as it's working hard to build
  protection against the disease.</p>
<h3>Common vaccine side effects may include: </h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr class="bg-primary">
      <td>Symptoms at the injection site, such as:</td>
      <td>Flu-like symptoms, such as:</td>

				<h3>Allergic reactions

				<ul>
				 <li>
					If you know you have allergies to any of the ingredients in the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, you should not receive it.</li>
				 <li>
					If you have experienced a serious allergic reaction to another vaccine, drug or food, you should talk to your health professional before you receive the vaccine.</li>

				<h3>Reports of extremely rare blood clots</h3>
				<p>Very rare cases of blood clots with low platelets have been reported in several countries.</p>

				<p>Blood clots are treatable. Early diagnosis can reduce complications. Seek medical attention if you experience symptoms of blood clots, like shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or neurological symptoms like persistent headaches. </p>

				<p>For most people, the risks associated with getting COVID-19 far outweigh the risks of a blood clot.</p>

				<p>Until we better understand the link between these rare blood clots events and the vaccine, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that the AstraZenca vaccine shouldn't be used for adults under 55 years of age.</p>

				<h3>Reporting a possible serious reaction</h3>
				<p>You should also report any serious reactions or side effects to your health
				  care provider. Reported allergic reactions and side effects to COVID-19
				  vaccines are published weekly:</p>

	<h2 id="authorization">Vaccine authorization</h2>
	
	<p>Health Canada's independent drug authorization process is recognized around the world for its high standards and rigorous review. Our decisions are based only on scientific and medical evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective. The benefits must also outweigh any risks.</p>
	
	<p>Find detailed technical information such as the product monograph and the regulatory decision summary:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/product-details">AstraZeneca vaccine regulatory authorization</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/covishield/product-details">COVISHIELD vaccine regulatory authorization</a></li>
		</ul>
	
<!--
		<h2 id="a5">Vaccine safety after authorization</h2>
		<p>As for all medicines, Health Canada will continue to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/regulatory-response-health-product-access.html#a8">monitor
				the safety</a> of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Canada closely. Along with the Public Health Agency of
			Canada and working in close collaboration with the provinces and territories and the manufacturer, we will monitor
			for any adverse events that may develop after immunization.</p>
		<p>Once the product is on the market, the manufacturer (Pfizer Canada ULC and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH) is
			legally required to submit reports of adverse events to Health Canada.</p>
		<p>The manufacturer is planning to follow clinical trial participants for at least 2 years after the second dose of
			the vaccine is given. It must communicate any potential safety concerns to Health Canada.</p>
		<p>To ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks, we may also impose terms and
			conditions at any time. For example, we can require the manufacturer to take further risk mitigation measures. We
			can also ask the manufacturer to submit additional safety information.</p>
		<p>Health Canada will continue to review all the available safety data as it becomes available. We will take
			appropriate action, if required, to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</p>
