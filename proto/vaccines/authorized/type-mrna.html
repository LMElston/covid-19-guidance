		<h2 id="about">About COVID-19 mRNA vaccines</h2>
		<p>Two of the vaccines approved for use in Canada are messenger RNA vaccines (called mRNA vaccines):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/vaccines/authorized/pfizer-biontech-revamp.html">Pfizer-BioNtech</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/vaccines/authorized/moderna-revamp.html">Moderna</a></li>
					
			</ul>
			
			<p>mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine. They don’t use live virus to trigger an immune response. Instead, they teach your cells 
				how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response. Once triggered, your body makes antibodies. These antibodies help you 
				fight the infection if the real virus does enter your body in the future. </p>
			
		<p>Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for quite some time. For example, they’ve been studied for use in flu,
			Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV), among others. Researchers have also used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target 
			certain cancer cells.</p>

		<p>mRNA vaccines can be developed faster than traditional methods because they're made in a lab using materials that are easily 
			available. Once developed, large-scale clinical trials are carried out to show that the vaccine is safe and effective.</p>
			
		<p>As with all vaccines, you  gain protection from an mRNA vaccine without having to risk the serious consequences of 
			getting sick from the virus.</p>
	
		<p>You can't get COVID-19 from the vaccine itself.</p>
			

		<h2 id="how">How COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work</h2>
			
		<p>Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a molecule that provides cells with instructions for making proteins. mRNA vaccines 
			contain the instructions for making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein is found on the surface of the virus 
			that causes COVID-19.</p>
			
		<p>The mRNA molecule is essentially a recipe, telling the cells of the body how to make the spike protein.</p>

			<p>COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are given by injection, usually into the muscle of the upper arm.</p>
			
		<p>After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them. The mRNA never enters the 
			central part (nucleus) of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is found.</p>
		
			<h2 id="safety">mRNA vaccine safety</h2>
			
		<p>COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are held to the same high standards for safety, effectiveness and quality as all vaccines authorized 
			for use in Canada.  Only vaccines that meet those standards can be approved.</p>
			
		<p>Once approved, we continue to monitor all vaccines for safety and effectiveness in people.</p>
			
		<p>We have a strong monitoring system for drug safety in Canada. Anyone who witnesses or experiences a side effect to a vaccine 
			is strongly encouraged to report it to their health care provider.</p>
	
			<p>Health care providers must <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/canadian-adverse-events-following-immunization-surveillance-system-caefiss.html#a1">report adverse events following immunization</a> to their local public health authority. The public health authority then reports them to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
