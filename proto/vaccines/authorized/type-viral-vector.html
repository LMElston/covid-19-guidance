		<h2 id="about">About COVID-19 viral vector-based vaccines</h2>
				
		<p>Two of the vaccines approved for use in Canada are messenger RNA vaccines (called mRNA vaccines):</p>
				
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/vaccines/authorized/astrazeneca-revamp.html">AstraZeneca</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/vaccines/authorized/janssen-revamp.html">Janssen</a></li>
					
			</ul>
				
		<p>These types of vaccines use a harmless virus (in this case, the adenovirus) as a delivery system. This vector virus is not the virus 
				that causes COVID-19. You can't get COVID-19 from the vaccine itself.</p>
				
		<p>Adenoviruses are viruses that cause the common cold. There are many different types, including those that cause colds in humans 
				and those that infect other species. Scientists have been using these viruses for decades to deliver the instructions 
				for proteins.</p>
				
		<h2 id="how">How viral vector-based vaccines work</h2>
				
		<p>Once injected into your body, the adenovirus in the vaccine produces the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein doesn't make you 
				sick. It does its job and then goes away.</p>
				
		<p>Through this process, your body can mount a strong immune response against the spike protein without exposing you to the virus that 
				causes COVID-19.</p>
				
		<h2 id="safety">Viral vector-based vaccine safety</h2>		
				
		<p>Viral vector-based technology has been used to develop::</p>
				
			<ul>
				<li>COVID-19 vaccines</li>
				<li>an Ebola vaccine</li>
				<li>many vaccines for animals</li>					
			</ul>
				
		<p>There's always a lot of attention paid to safety when a vaccine is developed. Everything we know about how viruses grow and 
				make proteins is strictly controlled when a vaccine is designed.</p>
				
		<p>Like all vaccines authorized for use in Canada, COVID-19 viral vector-based vaccines are held to high safety, effectiveness 
				and quality standards. Only vaccines that meet those standards can be approved.</p>
				
		<p>After we approve a vaccine, we continue to monitor it for safety and effectiveness.</p>
				
		<p>We have a strong monitoring system for drug safety in Canada. Anyone who witnesses or experiences a side effect to a vaccine
				is strongly encouraged to report it to their health care provider.</p>
	
		<p>Health care providers must <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/canadian-adverse-events-following-immunization-surveillance-system-caefiss.html#a1">report adverse events following immunization</a> to their local public health authority. The public health authority then reports them to the
				Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
