		 <summary>How groups are chosen for early vaccination</summary>
		 <p>The National  Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is an independent  committee of experts that provides advice to the Public Health Agency of Canada. This advice is then distributed and published to inform decision making  by provinces and territories, which are responsible for:
	<ul>
		<li>administering vaccines</li>
		<li>deciding which populations will receive them first</li>
	</ul>

<p>Recommendations aim reduce serious illness and death while reducing disruptions in society. </p>
<p>The committee chooses groups for early vaccination by looking at risk factors for  severe COVID-19 disease and outcomes, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>biological factors like:
		<ul>
			<li>advanced age</li>
			<li>pre-existing medical conditions</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>social factors like:
		<ul>
			<li>low socioeconomic status</li>
			<li>belonging to a racialized population</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision-making  process also includes a review of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ethics</li>
	<li>equity</li>
	<li>feasibility</li>
	<li>acceptability</li>
</ul>
<p>These  recommendations aim to reduce disruptions in society due to the pandemic by  prioritizing those who:</p>
<ul>
	<li>provide essential services </li>
	<li>take additional risks to protect the public</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations are based on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>population-based analysis of the risks and benefits that considers:
		<ul>
			<li>risk of exposure to COVID-19, including:
				<ul>
					<li>ability to physically distance</li>
					<li>access to other measures to prevent infection </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 </li>
			<li>how safe and effective authorized vaccines are in key populations </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>results of clinical trials </li>
	<li>vaccine supply, which is the timing of available doses and the number of:
		<ul>
			<li>available vaccine types</li>
			<li>doses each group needs </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>the current pandemic situation when vaccines become available </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Provinces and territories may have to adjust their strategy depending on local trends and transmission rates.</p>
