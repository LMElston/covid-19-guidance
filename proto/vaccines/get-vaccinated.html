<h2 id="a2">Who is eligible</h2>
	 <p>COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Canada are free of charge. They'll be available over the course of 2021 to everyone who's&nbsp;<strong>recommended to get the vaccine</strong>&nbsp;by federal, provincial and territorial public health authorities.</p>
<p>This applies to:</p>
	 <ul>
		 <li>everyone       in Canada, including those who aren't citizens and who are at least:
		 <ul>
			 <li>12 years of age for the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine</li>
			 <li>12 years of age for the Moderna Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine</li>
			 <li>18 years of age for the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria COVID-19 vaccine</li>
			 <li>18 years of age for the Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine</li>
		 </ul></li>

		 <li>Canadians serving in diplomatic and consular missions abroad (and their dependents) living in countries where the Health Canada-approved vaccines aren't available</li>
		 <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/campaigns/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines-for-canadian-armed-forces-members.html">Canadian Armed Forces members</a>&nbsp;who are serving abroad in countries where the Health Canada-approved vaccines aren't available</li>
	 </ul>
	 <h3>Special populations</h3>
	 <p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/type-mrna.html">mRNA COVID-19 vaccines</a> for everyone at least 12 years  of age. This includes people who:</p>
<ul>
		 <li>are       pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
		 <li>have       an autoimmune       disorder</li>
		 <li>are immunocompromised due to       disease or treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're unable to receive  an mRNA vaccine, for example because of an allergy, you may be offered another  approved COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p> If you're moderately to severely immunocompromised  due to disease or treatment, you may have a reduced immune response to  any COVID-19 vaccine. NACI  recommends you get an additional vaccine dose following your 1- or 2-dose  vaccine series. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="a4">When to consult with your doctor</h2>

<p>For some people, the decision to get vaccinated will require consideration of risks versus benefits.</p>

<p>You should consult your doctor or a health professional if you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>are immunocompromised due to a disease or treatment, such as chemotherapy</li>
	<li>have an autoimmune condition</li>
	<li>are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
	<li>have a severe allergy to an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a3">Benefits of vaccination</h2>
	 <p>Evidence indicates that vaccines are effective at preventing serious outcomes due to COVID-19, such as severe illness, hospitalization and death. People who have already had COVID-19 may also be offered 2 doses for future protection against the virus and its variants.</p>
	 <p>Recent reports in Canada indicate that less than 1% of those who were fully vaccinated have become ill with COVID-19.</p>

	 <h2 id="a5"><mark>If you need proof of your vaccination</mark></h2>
	 <mark>This content taken directly from Proof of vaccination page</mark>
	 <p>Vaccination records or receipts are issued by  your province or territory. Current COVID-19 vaccination documents aren’t  standardized for international travel. </p>
