        <h2 id="who">Who is eligible for the vaccine</h2>

	<p>Vaccines will be available at no charge over the course of 2021 to everyone in Canada. This includes those who aren't citizens and applies to:
	</p>
      <ul>
  	<li>people over the age of:
    		<ul>
	      	<li>16 for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine</li>
     		 <li>18 for the Moderna vaccine</li>

  	<li>diplomatic staff and their dependants</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Public health measures continue to be essential in limiting infection while a large enough number of people across Canada are vaccinated.</p>

	<h2 id="doctor">When to consult with your doctor</h2>

	<p>For some people, the decision to get vaccinated will require consideration of  risks versus benefits. </p>

	<p>Consider consulting your doctor or a health professional if you:  </p>

	<ul>
	<li>are immunocompromise due to a disease or treatment, such as chemotherapy</li>
  <li>have an autoimmune condition</li>
	<li>are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
	</ul>


	<!--

        <h2 id="a2">Vaccine effectiveness and safety</h2>
				<p>The currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe effective at preventing COVID-19.
			In Phase 3 clinical trials:
				</p>




	<ul>
	<li>the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was shown to be 95% effective</li>
        <li>the Moderna vaccine was shown to be 94.5% effective</li>
	</ul>

<!--		<p>Vaccination has started and will be expanded to the entire population throughout 2021 as vaccine supply increases.</p>-->

		<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization has provided guidelines on who should get vaccinated first.</p>

		<p>Your province or territory has the authority to decide who will be prioritized.</p>

		 <summary>How groups are chosen for early vaccination</summary>
		 <p>The <a href="/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/naci-membership-representation.html">National  Advisory Committee on Immunization</a> (NACI) is an independent  committee of experts that provides advice to the Public Health Agency of Canada. This advice is then distributed and published to inform decision making  by provinces and territories, which are responsible for administering vaccines  and deciding which populations will receive them first. </p>
<p>NACI’s  recommendations aim to achieve the goal of Canada’s pandemic response, which is  to reduce serious illness and death while reducing disruptions in society </p>
<p>The  committee chooses groups for early vaccination by looking at risk factors for  severe COVID-19 disease and outcomes, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>biological factors like:
		<ul>
			<li>advanced age</li>
			<li>pre-existing medical conditions</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>social factors like:
		<ul>
			<li>low socioeconomic status</li>
			<li>belonging to a racialized population</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision-making  process also includes a review of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ethics</li>
	<li>equity</li>
	<li>feasibility</li>
	<li>acceptability</li>
</ul>
<p>These  recommendations aim to reduce disruptions in society due to the pandemic by  prioritizing those who:</p>
<ul>
	<li>provide essential services </li>
	<li>take additional risks to protect the public</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations  are based on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>population-based analysis of the risks and benefits that considers:
		<ul>
			<li>risk of exposure to COVID-19, including:
				<ul>
					<li>ability to physically distance</li>
					<li>access to other measures to prevent infection </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 </li>
			<li>how safe and effective authorized vaccines are in key populations </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>results of clinical trials </li>
	<li>vaccine supply, which is the timing of available doses and the number of:
		<ul>
			<li>available vaccine types</li>
			<li>doses each group needs </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>the current pandemic situation when vaccines become available </li>
