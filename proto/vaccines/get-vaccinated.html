        <h2 id="who">Who is eligible for the vaccine</h2>

	<p>Vaccines will be available to everyone in Canada including those who aren't citizens. This applies to:
	</p>
      <ul>
  	<li>people over the age of:
    		<ul>
	      	<li>16 for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine</li>
     		 <li>18 for the Moderna vaccine</li>
    	</ul>
  	</li>
  	<li>Canadian Armed Forces personnel that are on active duty abroad</li>
  	<li>diplomatic staff and their dependants</li>
	</ul>


	<h2 id="doctor">When to consult with your doctor</h2>

	<p>For some people, the decision to get vaccinated will require consideration of  risks versus benefits. </p>

	<p>You should consult your doctor or a health professional if you:  </p>

	<ul>
	<li>have suppressed immunity due to a disease or treatment, such as chemotherapy</li>
        <li>have an autoimmune condition</li>
	<li>are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
	</ul>


	<!--

        <h2 id="a2">Vaccine effectiveness and safety</h2>
				<p>The currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe effective at preventing COVID-19.
			In Phase 3 clinical trials:
				</p>




	<ul>
	<li>the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was shown to be 95% effective</li>
        <li>the Moderna vaccine was shown to be 94.5% effective</li>
	</ul>

<p>More on these vaccines, including how they work, how they're given, ingredients, allergies, and possible side effects:

</ul>

	<h2 id="priority">Recommended priority groups</h2>

<!--		<p>Vaccination has started and will be expanded to the entire population throughout 2021 as vaccine supply increases.</p>-->

		<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has provided guidelines on who should get vaccinated first.</p>

		<p>Your province or territory has the authority to decide who will be prioritized.</p>

		<details>
			<summary>At-risk groups identified by NACI</summary>
			<ul>
					<li>residents and staff of shared living settings that provide care for seniors</li>
					<li>adults 70 years of age and older, beginning with adults 80 years of age and older, and then decreasing the age limit by
					5-year increments to age 70 years as supply becomes available</li>
					<li>health care workers who have direct contact with patients, including those who work in health care settings and personal
					support workers</li>
					<li>adults in <a href="https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1606941379837/1606941507767">Indigenous communities</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>As additional COVID-19 vaccines and supplies become available, the following populations should be offered
			vaccinations:</p>

			<ul>
					<li>health care workers not included in the initial rollout</li>
					<li>residents and staff of all other shared living settings, such as homeless shelters, correctional facilities, and housing
					for migrant workers</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/crtcl-nfrstrctr/esf-sfe-en.aspx">essential workers</a> who face additional risks to maintain services for the functioning of society</li>
