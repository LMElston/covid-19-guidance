<h2 id="a2">Who is eligible</h2>

<p>COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Canada are free. They're available to priority populations first. They'll then be available to everyone who is&nbsp;<strong>recommended to get the vaccine</strong>&nbsp;by federal, provincial and territorial public health authorities</p>

<p>This applies to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>everyone in Canada, including those who aren't citizens and who are over the:
		<ul>
			<li>age of 16 for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine</li>
			<li>age of 18 for the Moderna vaccine</li>
			<li>age of 18 for the AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine</li>
			<li>age of 18 for the Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) vaccine</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>diplomatic staff and their dependants</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/campaigns/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines-for-canadian-armed-forces-members.html">Canadian Armed Forces members</a> who are serving abroad as well as those working in higher-risk clinical settings, such as:
	  <ul>
	    <li>long-term care facilities</li>
	    <li>Indigenous communities</li>
	    <li>medical facilities run by the Canadian Armed Forces</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect our families, communities and ourselves against COVID-19.</p>

<p><a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/">How many people in Canada have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine</a></p>

<h2 id="a4">When to consult with your doctor</h2>

<p>For some people, the decision to get vaccinated will require consideration of risks versus benefits.</p>

<p>You should consult your doctor or a health professional if you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>are immunocompromised due to a disease or treatment, such as chemotherapy</li>
	<li>have an autoimmune condition</li>
	<li>are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
	<li>have a severe allergy to an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccine</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="a3">Continue to follow public health measures</h2>

<p>Everyone should continue to follow public health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The main personal preventive measures are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>staying at home if you’re feeling ill or have symptoms of COVID-19</li>
	<li>maintaining a 2-metre physical distance from others</li>
	<li>wearing a non-medical mask, as appropriate</li>
	<li>avoiding touching your face</li>
	<li>cleaning your hands often</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a5">Recommended priority groups</h2>

<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization has provided guidance on key populations for early COVID-19 vaccination. Groups at risk for severe illness or exposure to COVID-19 that <strong>may </strong>be offered early vaccination include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>residents and staff of shared living settings who provide care for seniors</li>
	<li>older adults</li>
	<li>health care workers</li>
	<li>adults in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1606941379837/1606941507767">Indigenous communities</a></li>
	<li>residents and staff of other shared living settings, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>quarters for migrant workers</li>
			<li>shelters</li>
			<li>correctional facilities</li>
			<li>group homes</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>adults in racialized and marginalized communities</li>
	<li>first responders, including:
		<ul>
			<li>police</li>
			<li>military</li>
			<li>firefighters</li>
			<li>coast guard</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Your province or territory has the authority to decide who will be prioritized.</p>

<details><summary><h3>How groups are chosen for early vaccination</h3></summary>

<p>The&nbsp;National Advisory Committee on Immunization&nbsp;(NACI) is an independent committee of experts that provides advice to the Public Health Agency of Canada. This advice is then distributed and published to inform decision making by provinces and territories, which are responsible for</p>

<ul>
	<li>administering vaccines</li>
	<li>deciding which populations will receive them first</li>
</ul>

<p>Recommendations aim to reduce serious illness and death while reducing disruptions in society.</p>

<p>NACI chooses groups for early vaccination by looking at risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease and outcomes, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>biological factors like:
		<ul>
			<li>advanced age</li>
			<li>pre-existing medical conditions</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>social factors like:
		<ul>
			<li>low socioeconomic status</li>
			<li>belonging to a racialized population</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision-making process also includes ethical elements, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>equity</li>
	<li>feasibility</li>
	<li>acceptability</li>
</ul>

<p>These recommendations aim to reduce disruptions in society due to the pandemic by prioritizing those who:</p>

<ul>
	<li>provide essential services</li>
	<li>take additional risks to protect the public</li>
</ul>

<p>Recommendations are based on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>population-based analysis of the risks and benefits that considers:
		<ul>
			<li>risk of exposure to COVID-19, including:
				<ul>
					<li>ability to physically distance</li>
					<li>access to other measures to prevent infection</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19</li>
			<li>how safe and effective authorized vaccines are in key populations</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>results of clinical trials</li>
	<li>vaccine supply, which is the timing of available doses and the number of:
		<ul>
			<li>available vaccine types</li>
			<li>doses each group needs</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>the current pandemic situation when vaccines become available</li>
</ul>

<p>Provinces and territories may have to adjust their strategy depending on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>local trends</li>
	<li>transmission rates</li>
	<li>vaccine management logistics</li>
</ul>
