	<h2 id="a1">Recommended priority groups</h2>




		<p>Everyone who lives in Canada will have access to a safe, effective and free COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. </p>


		<p>Canada’s COVID-19 vaccination rollout has begun, and Vwill be expanded to the entire population throughout 2021 as vaccine supply increases. </p>


		<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has identified the key populations who should get vaccinated first. </p>

	
	 <h3>Priority high-risk groups</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>residents and staff of shared living settings that provide care for seniors</li>
            <li>adults 70 years of age and older, beginning with adults 80 years of age and older, and then decreasing the age limit by
            5-year increments to age 70 years as supply becomes available</li>
            <li>health care workers who have direct contact with patients, including those who work in health care settings and personal
            support workers</li>
            <li>adults in <a href="https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1606941379837/1606941507767">Indigenous communities</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>As additional COVID-19 vaccine(s) and supplies become available, the following populations should be offered
        vaccinations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>health care workers not included in the initial rollout</li>
            <li>residents and staff of all other shared living settings, such as homeless shelters, correctional facilities, and housing
            for migrant workers</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/crtcl-nfrstrctr/esf-sfe-en.aspx">essential workers</a> who face additional risks to maintain services for the functioning of society</li>

		<p></p>



<!--
		<h2 id="a1">Producing a vaccine</h2>




		<p>Producing a vaccine is complex. It requires significant investments to ensure it can be produced on a large scale
			with good quality and consistency. Our <a
				href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/04/23/prime-minister-announces-new-support-covid-19-medical-research-and">investments
				in research</a> will help make sure Canada has faster access to safe and effective vaccines. </p>


		<p>Manufacturers manage the process for vaccine production. </p>


		<p>Both private and large public investments from governments around the world are being put toward research and
			development of COVID-19 vaccines. </p>


		<p>This partnership between private industry and the public can lead to more affordable and ground-breaking health
			products for Canada. </p>


		<h2 id="a2">Securing enough vaccine</h2>




		<p>In the future, there will likely be multiple safe and effective vaccines authorized in Canada to prevent
			COVID-19. We’re working to make sure everyone in Canada has access to them as quickly as possible. This includes
			working with provinces and territories, as they’re responsible for planning and running vaccination programs. The
		<mark>	<a
				href="data.html">advance
				purchase agreements</a></mark> we’ve signed will help us reach this goal. </p>


		<p>Because we don’t know which vaccines will be successful and authorized for use, we’re investing in a large
			selection of vaccines. </p>


		<p>We’re working hard to make sure vaccine doses are available as quickly as possible after authorization. But it
			will take time before there’s enough vaccine for everyone in Canada. This is why we’re working on recommendations
			for identifying priority populations for the first doses of vaccine with the: </p>




		<ul>
			<li>provinces and territories <strong>and</strong></li>
			<li>National Advisory Committee on Immunization </li>
		</ul>


		<p>The Government of Canada will provide additional support for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>securing storage facilities</li>
			<li>getting supplies (like needles, swabs and gauze) </li>
			<li>helping with distribution across the country</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="a4">Getting ready to distribute</h2>


		<p>We’ve temporarily allowed promising COVID-19 vaccines to be imported and stored in a licensed facility until
			they’ve been authorized in Canada. These facilities are equipped for proper vaccine storage. This temporary
			measure is called <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/interim-order-import-sale-advertising-drugs/note.html#a4.11">pre-positioning</a>
			and could lead to a quicker roll out of an authorized vaccine. For this to happen, the:</p>


		<ul>
			<li>Chief Public Health Officer of Canada must notify the Minister of Health of a need to pre-position a COVID-19
				vaccine</li>
			<li>Government of Canada must have an agreement to purchase the vaccine</li>
		</ul>




		<p>Also, the manufacturer of the vaccine must have filed an <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment.html#a2">application
				for market authorization</a> through one of the following regulatory processes:</p>


		<ul>
