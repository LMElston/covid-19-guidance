			<h2 id="a1">About the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine</h2>


			<p>The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) is used to prevent COVID-19. This disease is caused by severe acute
				respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</p>

			<p>The vaccine is approved for people who are 18 years of age and older. Its safety and effectiveness in people
				younger than 18 years of age have not yet been established.</p>
			<p>The Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is manufactured by Moderna Therapeutics Inc. Health Canada authorized this
				vaccine with conditions on December 23, 2020, under the <a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/enhealth-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/interim-order-import-sale-advertising-drugs/note.html">Interim
					Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19</a>.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Find detailed technical information about the Moderna vaccine, such as the product monograph and our regulatory
				decision summary, in the <a href="https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/moderna-covid-19-vaccine/product-details">COVID-19
					vaccines and treatments regulatory portal</a>.</p>

				<li>mRNA</li>

			<h2 id="a2">How it works </h2>


			<p>mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response without using the live
				virus that causes COVID-19. Once triggered, our body then makes antibodies. These antibodies help us fight the
				infection if the real virus does enter our body in the future.</p>

			<p>‘RNA’ stands for ribonucleic acid, which is a molecule that provides cells with instructions for making proteins.
				<a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/enhealth-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/type-mrna.html">Messenger
					RNA (mRNA) vaccines</a> contain the genetic instructions for making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein is
				found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>

			<p>When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions like a recipe and produce the
				spike protein. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them.</p>

			<p>The cell then displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune system recognizes that the protein doesn’t
				belong there and begins building an immune response and making antibodies.</p>

			<h2 id="a3">How it’s given </h2>


			<p>The vaccine is given by an injection (0.5 mL) into the muscle of the arm. For the vaccine to work best, you need to
				get 2 doses: a single dose and then a second dose one month apart.</p>

			<p>Based on studies in about 30,000 participants, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was 94.1% effective in preventing
				COVID-19 beginning 2 weeks after the second dose. This means that people may not be fully protected against COVID-19
				until at least 14 days after the second dose. &nbsp;</p>

			<h2 id="a4">Possible side effects</h2>


			<p>In general, the side effects observed during the clinical trials are similar to what you might have with other
				vaccines. </p>

			<p>The side effects that followed vaccine administration in clinical trials were mild or moderate. They included
				things like pain at the site of injection, body chills, feeling tired and feeling feverish. </p>
			<p>These are common side effects of vaccines and do not pose a risk to health. </p>

			<p>As with all vaccines, there’s a chance that there will be a serious side effect, but these are rare. A serious side
				effect might be something like an allergic reaction. Speak with your health professional about any serious allergies
				or other health conditions you may have before you receive this vaccine.</p>

			<p>Health Canada has conducted a rigorous scientific review of the available medical evidence to assess the safety of
				the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. No major safety concerns have been identified in the data that we reviewed. &nbsp;</p>

			<h2 id="a5">Vaccine safety after authorization</h2>


			<p>As for all medicines, Health Canada will continue to <a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/enhealth-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/regulatory-response-health-product-access.html#a8">monitor
					the safety</a> of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in Canada closely. Along with the Public Health Agency of Canada
				and working in close collaboration with the provinces and territories and the manufacturer, we will monitor for any
				adverse events that may develop after immunization.</p>

			<p>Once the product is on the market, the manufacturer (Moderna Therapeutics Inc.) is legally required to submit
				reports of adverse events and other safety information to Health Canada.</p>


			<p>The manufacturer is planning to follow clinical trial participants for at least 2 years after the second dose of
				the vaccine is given. It must communicate any safety concerns to Health Canada.</p>

			<p>To ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks, we may also impose terms and conditions
				at any time. For example, we can require the manufacturer to take further risk mitigation measures. We can also ask
				the manufacturer to submit additional safety information.</p>

			<p>Health Canada will continue to review all the available safety data as it becomes available. We will take
				appropriate action, if required, to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</p>
