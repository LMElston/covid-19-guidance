		<h2 id="a1">About COVID-19 mRNA vaccines</h2>
		<p>Many vaccines are being studied to see if they will prevent COVID-19, and Health Canada is expediting reviews of
			all COVID-19 <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/authorization/list-drugs.html">vaccine
				submissions</a>. Some of the vaccine candidates that are most advanced in development are messenger RNA vaccines
			(called mRNA vaccines).</p>
		<p>mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine. Many types of vaccines use a weakened or inactivated virus or part of a
			virus to trigger an immune response inside our body. However, instead of using the live virus that causes
			COVID-19, mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response. Once
			triggered, our body then makes antibodies. These antibodies protect us from being infected if the real virus does
			enter our body in the future.</p>
		<p>While Canada has not yet licensed these vaccines, researchers have been studying and working with them for quite
			some time. For example, they have been studied for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Researchers have
			also used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target certain cancer cells. Indeed, mRNA vaccine technology may
			one day lead to a single vaccine that can protect against many vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>
		<p>mRNA vaccines can be developed faster than traditional methods because they're made in a lab using materials that
			are easily available. However, these technology advancements don't replace the large-scale clinical trials needed
			to show that the vaccine is safe and effective.</p>
		<p>Like all vaccines, people who are vaccinated gain protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences
			of getting sick from being exposed to the virus. People also can't get COVID-19 from the vaccine itself.</p>
		<h2 id="a2">How COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work</h2>
		<p>'RNA' stands for ribonucleic acid, which is a molecule that provides cells with instructions for making proteins.
			RNA vaccines contain the instructions for making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein is found on the
			surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
		<p>Thus, the mRNA molecule is essentially a recipe, telling the cells of the body how to make the spike protein.</p>
		<p>COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are given by injection into the muscle of the upper arm.</p>
		<p>After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them. The mRNA never
			enters the central part (nucleus) of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is found.</p>
		<p>The cell then displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune system recognizes that the protein doesn't
			belong there and begins building an immune response and making antibodies.</p>
		<h2 id="a3">What we know about the safety of mRNA vaccines</h2>
		<p>Like all vaccines authorized for use in Canada, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines will be held to the same high safety,
			effectiveness and quality standards. Only mRNA vaccines that meet those standards will be approved.</p>
		<p>Once a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has been authorized for use in Canada, we will be monitoring its safety and
			effectiveness (how well it works) in people.</p>
		<p>We have a strong monitoring system for drug safety in Canada. Anyone who witnesses or experiences a side effect
			to a vaccine is strongly encouraged to report it to their health care provider.</p>
		<p>Health care providers are required to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/canadian-adverse-events-following-immunization-surveillance-system-caefiss.html#a1">report
				adverse events following immunization</a> to their local public health authority. The public health authority
			then reports them to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
		<p>For more information on drug safety, see <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment/safety-after-authorization.html">safety
