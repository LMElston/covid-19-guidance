		<h2 id="a1">Market authorization with conditions</h2>
		<p>Health Canada authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Tozinameran or BNT162b2) for use for the
			COVID-19 pandemic. Authorization followed section 5 of the <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/interim-order-import-sale-advertising-drugs.html">Interim
				Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19</a>.</p>
		<p>Due to the urgent public health needs relating to COVID-19, we can issue a market authorization with conditions
			to support early access to promising health products when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.</p>
		<p>The approval of the vaccine is supported by evidence that it is safe, effective and of good quality. Find
			detailed technical information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, such as the product monograph and our
			regulatory decision summary, in the <a
				href="https://covid-vaccine.canada.ca/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine/product-details">COVID-19 vaccines and
				treatments regulatory portal</a>.</p>
		<p>According to the terms and conditions that Health Canada placed on the authorization, the manufacturer (Pfizer
			Canada ULC and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH) will submit to Health Canada:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>monthly post-market safety monitoring reports, including information about serious and non-serious adverse
				drug reactions in Canada and abroad</li>
			<li>any further data on the long-term safety and effectiveness of the drug, including final data from ongoing
				clinical trials</li>
			<li>further quality data confirming that the manufacturing processes and controls will continue to consistently
				produce a product of suitable quality for the intended use</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="a2">Risk management plan </h2>
		<p>Companies are required to submit a risk management plan (RMP) to Health Canada when applying for any marketing
			authorization.</p>
		<p>RMPs include information on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a vaccine's safety profile</li>
			<li>how its risks will be prevented or minimized in patients</li>
			<li>plans for studies and other activities to gain more knowledge about the safety and effectiveness of the
				vaccine</li>
			<li>how the effectiveness of the measures that minimize risk will be determined</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Health Canada reviewed the RMP for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and found it to be acceptable.</p>
		<h2 id="a3">International considerations</h2>
		<p>In addition to working with the Public Health Agency of Canada and provinces and territories, Health Canada also
			exchanges information with our <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/engaging-international-partners.html">international
				regulatory counterparts</a> on an ongoing basis. This collaboration helps to support the review process,
			pharmacovigilance and post-market safety monitoring activities.</p>
		<p>We will continue to actively monitor and review all relevant data to determine whether changes to the market
			authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Canada are required.</p>
