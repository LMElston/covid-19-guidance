<h2 id="a1">Vaccine development</h2>
<p>Having safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines available will be an important tool to help
with the long-term management of COVID-19. Health Canada is&amp;nbsp;prioritizing the review
of all <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-
vaccines-treatments/about.html">COVID-19 drugs and vaccines</a>. </p>
<p>Creating a new vaccine can takes years. However, the development of vaccines for
COVID-19 is progressing quickly for many reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>advances in science and technology</li>
<li>international collaboration among scientists, health professionals, researchers, industry and
governments</li>
<li>increased dedicated funding </li>
</ul>

<p>There isn’t a vaccine authorized yet to prevent COVID-19, but research and development
are underway. Right now, there are more than <a
href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/who_table">150 potential COVID-19 vaccines</a> at
different stages of development around the world. </p>
<h2 id="a2">Reviewing and authorizing vaccines</h2>

<p>Health Canada’s independent drug authorization process is recognized around the world for
its high standards and rigorous review. Our decisions are based only on scientific and medical
evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective. The benefits must also outweigh any
risks. </p>
<p>To market a vaccine in Canada, the manufacturer must file an application to Health
Canada. They must use one of the following regulatory processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/interim-

order-respecting-clinical-trials-medical-devices-drugs.html">interim order for COVID-19 drug
authorization</a>
<ul>
<li>this process was set up to respond to the urgent need for COVID-19 drugs during the
pandemic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/c.r.c.,_c._870/page-
139.html#h-578215"><em>Food and Drug Regulations</em></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Health Canada has put in place a fast-tracked review process to assess COVID-19 vaccines.
If manufacturers apply through the interim order process, we’re able to start the review process
right away. We are also able to review any new evidence as it becomes available, instead of
waiting until all studies are completed. We’ve dedicated more scientific resources to complete
these reviews so that they’re done quickly but without cutting corners. </p>
<p>A similar process was used in 2009 to review and authorize the H1N1 pandemic vaccine.
</p>
<p>We’re also working with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-
products/covid19-industry/engaging-international-partners.html">international regulators</a>
to collaborate on the review process to get vaccines to market as quickly as possible. However,
Health Canada will always make independent, science-based decisions that are in the best
interest of the public. </p>
<p>As for all vaccines and treatments that are authorized in Canada, we’ll review the evidence
and scientific data. We’ll then decide whether to authorize the COVID-19 vaccine and will
only do so when the evidence shows that the vaccine:</p>
<ul>
<li>is safe, effective and of good quality <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>demonstrates that the benefits outweigh the risks</li>
</ul>

<p>These measures will help make safe and effective vaccines and treatments available faster
in Canada.</p>
<h2 id="a3">Reviewing and authorizing treatments </h2>

<p>There are also potential COVID-19 treatments that are being assessed in clinical trials. Find
out about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-
vaccines-treatments/authorization/list-drugs.html">COVID-19 treatments that are authorized in
Canada</a>. </p>
<p>Health Canada is fast-tracking the review of COVID-19 treatments by using similar review
processes as those for vaccines. Like vaccine authorizations, Health Canada will always make
treatment authorization decisions based on the best scientific evidence. </p>
