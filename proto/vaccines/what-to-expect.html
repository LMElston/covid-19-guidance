<h2 id="a1"> Authorized vaccines</h2>
<p>Health Canada has authorized vaccines for use in Canada. Not all of the
  authorized vaccines are available in all areas of the country.</p>
<p>All authorized vaccines <strong>are proven safe, effective and of high quality</strong>.</p>
<p>For detailed information on authorized vaccines, including how they work,  ingredients and possible side effects, go to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="authorized/astrazeneca-revamp.html">AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD</a></li>
		<li><a href="authorized/janssen-revamp.html">Janssen (Johnson & Johnson)</a></li>
	<li><a href="authorized/mModerna-revamp.html">Moderna</a></li>
	<li><a href="authorized/pfizer-biontech-revamp.html">Pfizer-BioNTech</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a2"> Before you get to your appointment</h2>
<p>Before you arrive at your vaccination appointment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>talk to your health care provider about any questions or concerns you may
    have about vaccination</li>
  <li> plan which strategies you'll use during vaccination to limit discomfort
    or pain</li>
  <li>contact your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/vaccines/how-vaccinated.html#a1">provincial or territorial health authority</a> if you have additional questions about how to prepare for your
    vaccination</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a3"> Tips for a comfortable vaccination experience</h2>
<p>Some people may experience pain or discomfort from vaccination because of
  the needle. But there are a number of techniques you can use to make the
  vaccination more comfortable and limit pain or discomfort.</p>
<p>Some helpful strategies include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sit upright during vaccination</li>
  <li> wear a short-sleeved or loose-fitting top</li>
  <li> relax your arm by letting it feel loose and jiggly</li>
  <li> use deep breathing to help you relax and feel calm</li>
  <li> if you feel dizzy or faint, tell the person who's vaccinating you right
    away</li>
  <li> distract yourself by reading or listening to music, or have a
    conversation</li>
  <li> talk to your health care provider ahead of time about pain relief that
    you can take</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a4">Possible side effects and reactions</h2>
<p>After getting vaccinated, it's common and normal to have <strong>temporary</strong> side effects. These can last a <strong>few hours to a few days</strong> after vaccination.</p>
<p>This is the body's natural response, as it's working hard to build
  protection against the disease.</p>
<h3>Common vaccine side effects may include: </h3>
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr class="bg-primary">
      <td>Symptoms at the injection site, such as:</td>
      <td>Flu-like symptoms, such as:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><ul>
          <li>redness</li>
          <li> soreness</li>
          <li> swelling</li>
        </ul></td>
      <td><ul>
          <li> chills</li>
          <li> fatigue</li>
          <li> joint pain</li>
          <li> headache</li>
          <li> mild fever</li>
          <li> muscle aches</li>
        </ul></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h3>Managing common side effects at home</h3>
<p>You can take medicine after your vaccination to help with any pain or to
  lower a fever. Ask your health care provider what they recommend to manage
  symptoms.</p>
<p>You can also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area you received the
    injection</li>
  <li>use or exercise your arm</li>
  <li>drink plenty of fluids</li>
</ul>
<h3>Allergic reactions</h3>
<p>Allergic (anaphylactic) reactions are <strong>very rare</strong>. Symptoms
  of an allergic reaction include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>hives (bumps on the skin that are often very itchy)</li>
  <li>swelling of the face, tongue or throat</li>
  <li>difficulty breathing</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  Call <strong>911</strong> right away if you develop any serious symptoms
  after vaccination or symptoms that could be an allergic reaction.</p>
<h3>Reporting a possible serious reaction</h3>
<p>You should also report any serious reactions or side effects to your health
  care provider. Reported allergic reactions and side effects to COVID-19
  vaccines are published weekly:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccine-safety/summary.html">Reported side effects following COVID-19 vaccination</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="after">After getting vaccinated</h2>
<p>The person vaccinating you will let you know where to wait and for how long
  after vaccination. The usual wait time is about 15 minutes or more. This
  allows time for you to be watched for possible reactions or side effects.
  Let someone know if you're experiencing any symptoms following vaccination.</p>
<p>After vaccination, ask for a record of any vaccines you receive.</p>
<p>Most COVID-19 vaccines require  2 doses. While current evidence shows good effectiveness after 1 dose, a second  dose is essential for longer-lasting and optimal protection. For your second  dose, return at the time advised by your health care provider. </p>

<h3>Continuing public health measures</h3>
<p>It isn't yet known whether the spread of COVID-19 can be stopped by
  vaccination alone. Because of this, it's essential that everyone continue
  to follow public health measures to help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our
  communities.</p>

<h3>Travelling</h3>
<p>At the moment, getting vaccinated doesn't exempt you from travel
  restrictions and quarantine requirements in Canada.</p>
