				<h2 id="authorized">Authorized vaccines and vaccine agreements</h2>

				<h3>Authorized vaccines</h3>

				<p>These vaccines have been authorized by Health Canada. </p>
				<p>Look for ingredients, allergies, how they work, how they're given and possible side effects: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="authorized/moderna.html">Moderna COVID-19 vaccine</a></li>

				<li><a
						href="authorized/pfizer-biontech.html">Pfizer-BioNTech
						COVID-19 vaccine </a></li>


				</ul>


				<h3>Vaccine agreements</h3>
				    <p>Canada has agreements to purchase seven different vaccines to use when they are authorized. </p>

						<p><a href="prevention-risks/covid-19-vaccine-treatment/procuring-vaccines.html#agreements">COVID-19 vaccine agreements and deliveries</a></p>


				<h2 id="safety">COVID-19 vaccines are safe</h2>

				<h3>Canada's vaccine approval process</h3>

				<p>While the government is making every effort to expedite COVID-19 vaccine development, safety and efficacy will not be compromised.</p>

				<p>Health Canada has a rigorous and independent scientific review system in place to ensure vaccines are safe and effective. We will only authorize a vaccine if its benefits clearly outweigh its risks. </p>

				<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/biologics-radiopharmaceuticals-genetic-therapies/activities/fact-sheets/regulation-vaccines-human-canada.html">Regulating vaccines process</a></p>


				<h3>How COVID-19 vaccines work</h3>

				<p>There are 2 main types of vaccines: viral vector-based and mRNA vaccines.</p>

				<ul class="list-unstyled">
				 <li>
				  <details>
				   <summary> Traditional viral vector-based vaccines</summary>

				<p>These types of vaccines use a harmless virus (in this case, the adenovirus) as a delivery system. Just like with a natural infection, when the immune cells in the body are exposed to parts of the virus in a vaccine, antibodies are developed and immune cells are primed to respond to prevent infection.</p>


				<ul>
					<li><a href="authorized/type-viral-vector.html">viral vector-based vaccines</a></li>
				</ul>

			</details>
				</li>
				<li>
				<details>

					<summary>New mRNA vaccines</summary>
				<p>They are a new type of vaccine that don’t contain viruses or bacteria. </p>
				<p>RNA (ribonucleic accid) vaccines contain the instructions for making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
				<p>Our immune system recognizes that the protein doesn't belong there and begins building an immune response and making antibodies.</p>
				<p>mRNA vaccines don’t modify people’s DNA.</p>


				<ul>
					<li><a href="authorized/type-mrna.html">mRNA vaccines</a></li>
				</ul>

			</details>
				</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Safety of approved COVID-19 vaccines</h3>

				<p>We monitor the safety and effectiveness of all approved vaccines</p>

				<p>Go to the specific vaccine page for information about side effects, allergies and possible contra-indications:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="authorized/moderna.html">Moderna COVID-19 vaccine</a></li>

				<li><a
						href="authorized/pfizer-biontech.html">Pfizer-BioNTech
						COVID-19 vaccine </a></li>


				</ul>

				<h3>Adverse effects after immunization</h3>

				<p>Health care providers are required to report adverse events following immunization to their local public health authority. The public health authority then reports them to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/canadian-adverse-events-following-immunization-surveillance-system-caefiss.html#a1">Report adverse events following immunization</a></li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="effectiveness">COVID-19 vaccines are effective</h2>

				<h3>Effectiveness in trials</h3>
				<div class="row">

					<div class="col-md-6 mrgn-tp-md panel panel-default">
						<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Moderna vaccine</strong> <br/>
							<span class="text-info h2">94% </span>  proven effectiveness</p>

						<p><strong><a href="#">Source</a></strong> </p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-md-6 mrgn-tp-md panel panel-default">
						<p class="mrgn-tp-md"><strong>Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine</strong> <br/>
							<span class="text-info h2">95% </span> proven effectiveness</p>

						<p><strong><a href="#">Source</a></strong> </p>
					</div>


				</div>
				<h3>Building up immunity takes time</h3>

				<p>Currently, both Moderna and Pfizer are two-shot vaccines. </p>

				<p>One dose of vaccine may not be enough to provide individual protection. You may need to get a second shot to allow your body to develop adequate immunity. </p>

				<p>We don't yet know what level of immunity in the population is sufficient to achieve community immunity. </p>

				<p>Until that time, Canadians should continue to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>wash their hands</li>
					<li>stay home when sick </li>
					<li>maintain physical distancing</li>
					<li>wear a face mask as appropriate</li>
					 <li>keep using good cough and surface hygiene</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>New variants</h3>

				<p>So far, trials suggest that the approved vaccines are effective against the new variants of COVID-19.</p>
				<p>We will continue monitoring the situation.</p>
