            <p>The revenue drop is the decline in eligible revenue you experienced when comparing your claim period revenue with your revenue from a specific period of time prior to March 2020 (the “prior reference period”):</p>
            <p><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> <strong>Revenue drop (%) = 1 –  (Claim period revenue / prior reference period revenue)</strong></p>
            <h4 id="deeming">Using the current or previous claim period revenue drop to qualify (the “deeming rule”)</h4>
            <p>If your revenue drop for the previous claim period was high enough to qualify you for the hiring program, you automatically qualify for the current claim period. 
		    If you use the <a href="">online calculator or spreadsheet</a> to calculate your  subsidy amount, both revenue drops will be calculated when you enter your revenues and the qualifying rate will automatically be applied.</p>
