                           <details><summary>Technical details of who is an eligible employer for CRHP</summary> 
			<p>Generally, if you are eligible for the CEWS, you would be  eligible for the CRHP. However, there are additional requirements for  corporations and partnerships:</p>
<p>For a <strong>corporation</strong> (other than a corporation that is exempt from tax under Part I of the Income  Tax Act) to be eligible for CRHP, it must be a Canadian-controlled private  corporation (including a cooperative corporation that is eligible for the small  business deduction). </p>
<p>For a <strong>partnership</strong> to be eligible for CRHP, no more than half the interest in the partnership  (determined by fair market value) can be held by any combination of  non-eligible employers and corporations that don&rsquo;t meet the condition for  corporations in (i) above. </p>
<p>Corporations and trusts that are not eligible for  the CEWS because they are public institutions would not be eligible for the  CRHP either.</p>
  <p>Read <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html#q3">Q3 – Which  employers are eligible for the wage subsidy on the CEWS FAQs</a> to learn more  about eligible employers for the CEWS. </p>

            <p>The revenue drop is  the decline in eligible revenue you experienced when comparing your claim period revenue with your revenue from a specific period of time prior to March 2020 (the “prior reference period”):</p>
            <p><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> <strong>Revenue drop (%) = 1 –<span class="wb-inv"> minus</span> (Claim period revenue / prior reference period revenue)</strong></p>
            <h4 id="deeming">Using the current or previous claim period revenue drop to qualify (the “deeming rule”)</h4>
            <p>If your revenue drop for the previous claim period was high enough to qualify you for the hiring program, you automatically qualify for the current claim period. 
		    If you use the <a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/calculate-wage-hiring-subsidies/how-much.html">online calculator or spreadsheet</a> to calculate your  subsidy amount, both revenue drops will be calculated when you enter your revenues and the qualifying rate will automatically be applied.</p>

               <p>Your revenue drop can’t be negative. If the result is negative, then your actual revenue drop for the claim period is 0%. </p>
