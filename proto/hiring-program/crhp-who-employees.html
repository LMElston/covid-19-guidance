    <p>The hiring subsidy amount is based on how much your overall pay to your eligible employees has increased since the period of March 14 to April 10, 2021. This change in overall pay is referred to as your incremental remuneration. To calculate this amount, you will need pay information for your eligible employees.</p>

		<h2 id="h-1">Who are eligible employees</h2>
		<p>An eligible employee is a person who was employed by you (the eligible employer) primarily in Canada throughout the claim period.</p>
		<p>You cannot include employees who had 14 or more consecutive unpaid days in the period.</p>
		<p>Employee eligibility depends on the person being <a href="/crhp-frequently-asked-questions.html#q13-1">employed in Canada, not living in Canada</a>.</p>
		<h3 id="retro">Retroactively hiring and paying employees</h3>
		<p>Employees you laid off can become eligible retroactively, as long as you rehire and pay them so they meet the eligibility criteria for the claim period. You must rehire and pay these employees before you include them in your subsidy claim.</p>

		<p><a href="/crhp-frequently-asked-questions.html#h_4">Read more about employee eligibility</a></p>
		<h3 id="nonarm">Arm’s-length and non-arm's-length eligible employees</h3>
		<div id="nonarm-cntnt">
			<p>You will be asked whether an employee is arm’s length or not when you calculate your subsidy amount, because <strong>the subsidy is calculated differently</strong> for eligible non-arm’s-length and arm’s-length employees.</p>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>Arm's-length employees</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>For most small businesses, workers are usually <strong>arm’s-length</strong> employees unless they are an owner or an owner’s family member.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Non-arm's-length employees</dt>
				<dd>In a small business, a <strong>non-arm’s-length</strong> employee would most often be:
					<p></p>
					<ul>
						<li>a business owner</li>
						<li>a member of an owner’s immediate family (for example, a spouse, parent, child, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It’s possible (but less common) for a non-arm’s-length employee relationship to exist between unrelated people, depending on the circumstances. </p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>If you’re not sure about whether an employee is considered arm’s length or non-arm’s length, or have a business involving more complex control (like a corporation, trust, or partnership), you can read more about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/series-1-individuals/income-tax-folio-s1-f5-c1-related-persons-dealing-arms-length.html">specific relationships that are considered non-arm’s length</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="leave">Active employees and employees on leave with pay</h3>
		<div id="leave-cntnt">
			<p>For the hiring subsidy, employees on leave with pay are <strong>not</strong> eligible to be included in your claim. Employees who were on short paid absences from work (like vacation) can be included.</p>
			<p>Whether an eligible employee is active or on leave with pay is determined one week at a time in the <a href="/crhp-calculate-subsidy-amount.html#h-3">subsidy calculator</a>.</p>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>Active employees</dt>
				<dd>Are employees who worked for any part of a week during the claim period.</dd>
				<dt>Employees on leave with pay</dt>
				<dd>Are employees who were temporarily furloughed for one or more full weeks in the claim period but were still receiving pay for those weeks. To be considered on leave with pay for a week within a claim period, an employee must:
					<ul>
						<li>have received full or partial pay from you for the week</li>
						<li><strong>not</strong> have worked at all during the full week</li>
						<li><strong>not</strong> have been on paid absence (such as vacation leave, sick leave, or a sabbatical)</li>
						<li>have been in an employer-employee relationship with you at the time (they were not terminated)</li>

			<p>For all eligible employees, you will need to know how much eligible remuneration you paid them in respect of each week in the claim period. They must have received their pay before you apply for the subsidy.</p>
			<p>If your pay schedule doesn’t align with the wage subsidy claim period dates, you will have to manually calculate how much you paid the employee in respect of each week. It doesn’t matter whether the employee receives their paycheque at the end of the week, at the end of the month, or another time, as long as you use the actual amount they were paid that relates to that week. You can’t use an average of daily wages.</p>
			<p>If you pay employees weekly or bi-weekly, you can use the calculator spreadsheet to enter your employees’ pay.</p>

			<p>For the hiring subsidy, you only need to calculate pre-crisis pay for non-arm's-length eligible employees.</p>
			<p>Pre-crisis pay (baseline remuneration) is an average amount of eligible remuneration the employee received in a week during a specific period before March&nbsp;15, 2020.</p>
			<p>If you have hired <strong>new eligible employees</strong> who did not work for you prior to March 15, 2020, their pre-crisis pay will be $0.</p>
