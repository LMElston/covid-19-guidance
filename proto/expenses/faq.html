            <h2 id="h-1">Is this a credit or deduction?</h2>
            <p>These expenses can be claimed as a deduction on employees personal income tax return. Deductions reduce the amount of income you pay tax on, so they reduce your overall income tax. The more deductions that apply to you, the less your taxable income becomes.</p>
            <h2 id="h-2">What if you chose to work from home?</h2>
            <p>If you are not required to work from home but your employer provides you with the choice to work at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, then the CRA will consider you to be required to work from home. </p>
            <p>You must still meet the other <a href="who-apply.html">eligibility criteria</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="h-3">How do I chose what method to use?</h2>
            <p>If you meet the <a href="who-apply.html">eligibility criteria</a>, there are now two options to claim home office expenses for the 2020 tax year:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Temporary flat rate method</li>
               <li>Detailed method</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information refer to <a href="choose.html">compare the claim methods</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="h-6"><mark>If a home is shared by two or more people, do they all have to use the same method to calculate home office expenses? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h2>
            <p><mark>Each employee working from home can use the temporary flat rate method or the detailed method to calculate their claim, if they meet the eligibility criteria for the method. This is determined individually.</mark></p>
			<p><mark>If you share a workspace with others, you will each calculate your own employment use of the shared work space.  You can find examples of how to do this on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-229-other-employment-expenses/work-space-home-expenses/work-space-use.html">Home offices expenses for employees – Determine your work space use</a>.</mark></p>

            <h3 id="h-4-1">Will the temporary flat rate method be extended past 2020?
            </h3>
            <p>The temporary flat rate method will only be in place for the 2020 tax year.</p>
            <h3 id="h-4-2">Is the temporary flat rate method claim amount by individual or by household? 
            </h3>
            <p>Each individual working from home who meets the eligibility criteria can use the temporary flat rate to calculate their home office expenses deduction.</p>
            <h3 id="h-4-3">What is expense types are covered by the $2 a day flat rate?
            </h3>
            <p>The temporary flat rate method is used to claim work-space-in-the-home-expenses like rent, electricity and internet access fees, as well as office supplies like pen and paper and cell phone minutes.</p>
            <p>If you use the temporary flat rate method, you cannot claim any other employment expenses (for example motor vehicle expenses). </p>
            <h3 id="h-4-4">What is the minimum amount of hours you need to work in a day to claim the $2 a day flat rate?
            </h3>
            <p>If you meet the <a href="who-apply.html">eligibility criteria - Temporary flat rate method</a>, any day that you worked from home in 2020 due to COVID- 19 counts in determining the number of days for which you can claim $2 a day. </p>
            <h3 id="h-4-5">What if you don’t work the full day at home? 
            </h3>
            <p>You can still claim the $2 a day, if you meet the <a href="who-apply.html">eligibility criteria - Temporary flat rate method</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="h-4-6">What if you work a day of overtime at home?</h3>
            <p>You can still claim the $2 a day, if you meet the <a href="who-apply.html">eligibility criteria - Temporary flat rate method</a>.
            <h3 id="h-4-7">What if you are on paid leave?</h3>
            <p>Neither paid leave nor unpaid leave is counted in determining:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>whether you worked from home more than 50% of the time for a period of at least a month (four consecutive weeks) in 2020 due to COVID-19</li>
               <li>the number of days for which you can claim $2 a day</li>
            </ul>
			
			
			 <h3 id="h-4-8"><mark>Do statutory holidays count as a work day for the temporary flat-rate method? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
			 <p><mark>No. Only the days the employee worked from home, full-time or part-time, count as a work day for the temporary flat-rate method.</mark></p>
			  <h3 id="h-4-9"><mark>If an adult child lived and worked at their parent’s home but did not pay anything toward the home expenses, can they use the temporary flat-rate method to claim employment expenses? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
<p><mark>An adult child who worked from a parent’s home but did not pay any eligible home office expenses for that period cannot claim a deduction for home office expenses. This applies to both the temporary flat-rate method and the detailed method, and it applies even if they meet the other eligibility criteria for claiming these expenses (worked at home more than 50% of the time for at least four consecutive weeks in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic).</mark></p>
<h3 id="h-4-10"><mark>If an employee uses the temporary flat-rate method, can the CRA review their claim? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
<p><mark>Each year, the CRA conducts review activities to maintain the integrity of the Canadian tax system and public confidence in that system. Whether taxpayers use the temporary flat-rate method or the detailed method for their 2020 return, the CRA may review claims to validate eligibility and amounts claimed.</mark></p>
            <h2 id="h-5">Detailed method</h2>
            <h3 id="h-5-1">What is Form T2200 used for? </h3>
            <p><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2200.html">Form T2200 Declaration of Conditions of Employment</a> is a form your employer fills out to certify you met the conditions of employment and had to pay for employment expenses under your contract. </p>

			<p>The T2200S is kept by you and is <strong>not</strong> included with your tax return.</p>
            <h3 id="h-5-3">What is Form T777 used for? </h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t777.html">Form T777 Statement of Employment Expenses</a> is the statement of employment expenses which is used to calculate the employee's allowable employment expenses.</p>

<p><mark>For the 2020 tax year, to reduce in-person contact, the CRA will recognize an electronic signature on Form T2200 and Form T2200S as meeting the requirements of the Income Tax Act.</mark></p>
<p><mark>Under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, an electronic signature means a signature that consists of one or more letters, characters, numbers or other symbols in digital form incorporated in, attached to or associated with an electronic document.

			 <h3 id="h-5-6"><mark>Can employees claim Internet charges? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
            <p><mark>If using the detailed method, you can claim the employment portion of what you paid for monthly home Internet access. However, you cannot claim connection fees or the rental cost for a modem, router or Wi-Fi booster.

			<p><mark>You calculate the employment-use amount of home Internet access fees the same way as other work-space-in-the-home expenses, such as electricity, heat and water. An example of how to calculate the employment-use amount of these expenses is included at the bottom of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t777s.html">Form T777S - Statement of Employment Expenses for Working at Home Due to COVID-19</a>, and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t777.html">Form T777 - Statement of Employment Expenses</a>.</mark></p>
			<h3 id="h-5-7"><mark>How does the detailed method work if the person used their home office for their employment duties and for their self-employed business activities? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
			<p><mark>Employees and businesses must meet different conditions under the Income Tax Act to claim a deduction for home office expenses from their employment or business income.</mark></p>
			<p><mark>You can deduct home office expenses <strong>only</strong> from the income (employment or business) that the expenses relate to. As a result, you will need to divide your work-space-in-the-home-expenses on a reasonable basis between employment and business use. For information about home office expenses for self-employed persons, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/report-business-income-expenses/completing-form-t2125/business-use-home-expenses.html">Business-use-of-home expenses</a>.</mark></p>
			<h3 id="h-5-8"><mark>If spouses meeting the eligibility criteria both worked from home to earn employment income, how do they each calculate their work-space-in-the-home expenses using the detailed method? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
			<p><mark>You have to first determine the expenses you can claim and then calculate the total employment-use amount of those expenses:</mark></p>
			<ol>
				<li><mark>Expenses you can claim</mark>

<p><mark>To claim a deductible employment expense, you must have paid the amount yourself. You cannot claim any part of the expense that was  reimbursed by your employer.</mark></p>

<p><mark>The CRA generally allows some flexibility in letting you and your spouse decide how to share home office expense, as long as you meet <strong>both</strong> of these requirements: </mark>
<ul>
<li><mark>you reduce the amount of any expense by the amount of any reimbursement that either spouse received for the expense</mark></li>

<li><mark>the expense is claimed as a deduction <strong>only once</strong></mark></li>
</ul> 

<p><mark>For example, John and Jane are common-law partners.  They paid $1,400 monthly for rent.  Either John or Jane (but not both) can claim the full $1,400, or they can share the total of $1,400 as they want (50/50, 70/30, 40/60, etc.).</mark></p></li>
<li>
<mark>Employment-use amount of those expenses</mark>

<p><mark>When more than one employee (a person who earns employment income) works in the same home, it may influence how you calculate the employment-use for the work space. This depends on whether you share a single work space or work in different work spaces in the home.</mark>

<dl><dt><mark>Different work spaces in a home</mark></dt>
<dd><mark>If employees work from different work spaces in the same home, they will each calculate the employment-use portion of the space they use, independently of the other employees.</mark></dd>

<dt><mark>Shared work space in a home</mark></dt>
<dd><mark>If employees share a work space in the home, they have to calculate their employment-use amount based on the portion they each use of that space. They then apply that percentage to the expense amount determined under 1) to calculate the amount of work-space-in-the-home expenses they can claim.</mark></dd>

<h3 id="h-5-9"><mark>If the employer sets a maximum limit on expense reimbursements, and the employee spent more than that limit, can the employee claim an amount for expenses that exceeded the reimbursement? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
<p><mark>Yes, if the employee meets the eligibility criteria for the detailed method, they can use that method to claim the portion of the eligible expenses that was not reimbursed.</mark></p>
<h3 id="h-5-10"><mark>When using the detailed method, if an employee’s work space was a common (shared) area, they have to consider the hours they worked each week when calculating the employment-use amount of the expenses. If the number of hours they worked changed from week to week, can they average their weekly hours for this calculation? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
<p><mark>Yes, if the expenses are similar each month, the employee can average their working hours to calculate the employment-use amount of their expenses for the total period.</mark></p>



<h3 id="h-5-13"><mark>Are employers obligated to provide Form T2200S, Declaration of Conditions of Employment for Working at Home Due to COVID-19, when requested by employees? <span class="label label-info">New</span></mark></h3>
<p><mark><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-229-other-employment-expenses/work-space-home-expenses/who-claim/detailed-method.html">Eligible employees</a> who want to use the detailed method to claim their home office expenses <strong>must</strong> have a completed and signed Form T2200S from their employer. The employer is not responsible for verifying the details of an employee’s claim.</mark></p>
<p><mark>To make it easier for employers, the CRA created Form T2200S. The employers need to answer yes or no to three questions and certify that the employee worked from home in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was required to pay for some or all of their eligible home office expenses. If those two conditions are met, the employer should complete and sign Form T2200S upon employee request.</mark></p>
