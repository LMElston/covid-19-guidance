During these months, she worked exclusively from home and performed all the duties that she normally performed at her employer’s office.

					 <p>Kumi can also choose to use the detailed method to claim work-space-in-the-home expenses in 2020. Using the detailed method, Kumi can claim the expenses she paid for the period when she worked from home for at least a month (between April 1 and May 31, 2020) if she meets the other conditions. Kumi cannot claim work-space-in-the-home expenses for the 25 days she worked from home between August and December 2020 because she did not work more than 50% of the time from home during that period.</p>
