               <h2 id="h-1">CEWS is taxable</h2>
               <p>The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy is considered government assistance and is taxable, unless you are exempt from income tax.</p>
               <p>As an employer who received CEWS, you must report the subsidy on your income tax or information return for the tax year (fiscal period) in which you are considered to have received it.</p>
               
               <h3>CEWS is considered received on last day of the claim period</h3>
               <p>The CEWS is generally considered received on the last day of the claim period it relates to. For example, if you applied for and received the wage subsidy for claim period 10 (November 22 to December 19, 2020), we would consider you to have received the amount on December 19, 2020, even if you did not apply for period 10 on that date, or receive the funds until 2021.</p>

               <h2 id="h-2">How you report CEWS income depends on your business</h2>
               <p>You may be able to elect to reduce related wage expenses by the amount of government assistance you received.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, you have to include the assistance in your income. How you include this income in your income tax or information return depends on the type of employer you are.</p>

               <h3>Corporations</h3>
               <p>Enter the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 295 of Schedule 1 of your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return and write “Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy” on the corresponding line 605.</p>
               <p>If you are a member of a partnership, you must reflect any CEWS amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you in the amount you enter on line 129, “Income or loss for tax purposes – partnerships”.</p>
               <p>Do not include amounts of CEWS you received for the tax year under item 8242 of the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI).</p>

               <h3>Trusts</h3>
               <p>Include the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 19, “Other income” of your T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return.</p>
               <p>If you are a member of a partnership, any CEWS amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you should also be entered on line 19.</p>

               <h3>Partnerships</h3>
               <p>Report CEWS amounts you received as income on form T5013SCH1, Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes – Schedule 1.</p>
               <p>As a member of a partnership, you must reflect any CEWS amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you in the amount you enter on line 109, “Income or loss for tax purposes from partnerships”.</p>
               <p>Enter the total CEWS amount the partnership received for the fiscal period on any of lines 290 to 294 and write “Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy” on whichever of lines 600 to 604 corresponds to the line used to ender the amount.</p>
               <p>Do not include amounts of CEWS the partnership received for the fiscal period under item 8242 of the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI).</p>
               
               <h3>Individual employers</h3>
               <mark>[details here, if available]</mark>

               <h3>Tax-exempt employers</h3>
               <p>If you are an income tax-exempt entity (such as a registered charity or a non-profit organization) that has received a CEWS amount as an eligible employer, you may have to report the total amount you received on the information return (if any) that applies to your situation, even though this amount is not taxable to you.</p>
               <h4>Registered charities</h4>
               <p>Use the T3010, Registered Charity Information Return, to report a CEWS amount you received as income.</p>
               <p>If you are a registered charity that does not have to complete Schedule 6, you can report CEWS amounts you received in income by checking “Yes” at line 4565, “Did the charity receive any revenue from any level of government in Canada?” of Section D and including the total CEWS amount you received for the fiscal period on line 4570.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, include the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 4540, “Total revenue received from federal government” of Schedule 6.</p>
               <h4>Registered Canadian amateur athletic association</h4>
               <p>There is no particular line on form T2052, Registered Canadian
               Amateur Athletic Association Information Return, to report the CEWS.
               The financial statements for the fiscal period covered by the return
               should indicate the different sources of revenue in enough detail to
               show how funds were spent and invested.</p>
               <h4>Registered journalism organizations</h4>
               <mark>[details here, if available]</mark>
               <h4>Other tax-exempt eligible employers</h4>
               <p>If your organization is required to file the NPO Information Return, include the total CEWS amount your organization received for the tax year on line 101, “Federal, provincial, and municipal grants and payments” of form T1044, Non-Profit Organization (NPO) Information Return. For more information on whether the organization you represent has to file a NPO Information Return, see guide T4117, Income Tax Guide to the Non-Profit Organization (NPO) Information Return.</p>

               <h2 id="h-3">T4 reporting requirements for employers</h2>
               <p>For the 2020 tax year, employers must include additional information on the T4 slip, Statement of Remuneration Paid.
               <p>If you have already filed your T4 slips and summary for 2020, youdo not need to refile.</p>
               <h3>How to report employment income during COVID-19 pay periods</h3>
               <p>In addition to reporting employment income in Box 14 or Code 71 for 2020, use new other information codes when reporting employment income and retroactive payments during the following periods:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Code 57: Employment income – March 15 to May 9</li>
                  <li>Code 58: Employment income – May 10 to July 4</li>
                  <li>Code 59: Employment income – July 5 to August 29</li>
                  <li>Code 60: Employment income – August 30 to September 26</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Example: If you are reporting employment income for the period of April 25 to May 8, payable on May 14, use code 58.</p>
               <p>These codes will help the CRA validate payments made under CEWS as well as other COVID-related benefits that are based on employment income.</p>

               <h2 id="h-4">Employees must report wages even if paid with CEWS</h2>
               <p>Employment income will appear on the T4 as usual, whether their employer used the CEWS to pay their wages or not, and should be reported on their individual tax return according to the T4 instructions.</p>
               <p>Employees may see other information boxes related to CEWS (codes 57, 58, 59, or 60) on the T4 slip they receive. These boxes are for information only and do not need to be reported on their tax return.</p>
               <p>There are no T4A slips issued for CEWS, as there are for COVID benefits paid directly to individuals.</p>
